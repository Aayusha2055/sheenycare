I"¯<p><strong>Hydrating Cleanser:</strong>
Use a very gentle but hydrating cleanser for about a minute to cleanse your skin.
Something as gentle as the <u>Himalaya moisturizing aloe vera face wash</u> is a blessing to your skin. And if you would want to steep a little high, opt for a <u>cetaphil gentle skin cleanser</u>. Just make sure the product youâ€™re using doesnâ€™t let your skin feel tight and stripping after the wash.</p>
