I"´<p>I used to really exfoliate with physical exfoliatorsâ€¦tsk tsk, I know right, I didnâ€™t have the access to the right information like you guys do now <em>wink</em>.Â </p>

<p>After some research, I found out about our elixir, Salicylic Acid! Fantastically, infused inÂ  CeraVe Renewing Salicylic Acid Cleanser. As a result, I havenâ€™t been turning back ever since.Â </p>

<p>Salicylic Acid also improves dryness and softens the rough skin, we should really appreciate it <em>salutes</em>!</p>

<p>The product we really vouch for is by CeraVe, CeraVe Renewing Salicylic Acid Cleanser infused with salicylic acid enhances the barrier-strengthening with the ingredients like ceramides.</p>
