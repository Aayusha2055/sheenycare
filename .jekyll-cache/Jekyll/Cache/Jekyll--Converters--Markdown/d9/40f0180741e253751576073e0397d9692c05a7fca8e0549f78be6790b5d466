I"m<p>The most effective way of taking care of the skin is by understanding oneâ€™s skin type. Skin care is an art and science and we all can learn this art. However, one should always know oneâ€™s skin type in order to take care of it properly.</p>

<p>While there are various products in the market that you can benefit from, but you might as well be using the wrong products for your skin unless you understand what your skin type is and what you should be giving to your skin.</p>

<p>This way, you will be taking care of your skin as well as avoiding products that might be not suitable for your skin.</p>

<p>For that, we first need to <a href="https://www.sheenycare.com/determine-your-skin-type/" target="_blank">determine our skin type</a>. Basically, there are two easy approaches to doing so.</p>

<h1 id="the-bare-faced-method">The Bare-Faced Method</h1>
<p>The bare-faced method is an easy way to determine oneâ€™s skin type. In this method, you should take a good amount of cleanser and cleanse your face for a minute. Wash off with normal water, pat your skin dry and refrain yourself from using any skin care products.</p>

<p>After 20-30 minutes, you should observe your skin. There are basically three conditions your face might be in after waiting for an hour.</p>

<p>Does your skin feel moisturized, shiny, and sticky without applying any products? You might have oily skin. Or, does your skin feels tight and strippy? This could be a sign of dry skin and does your skin feels oily at t-zone i.e the nose and the forehead and dry at other parts, you might have combination skin.</p>

<h1 id="the-blotting-sheet-method">The Blotting Sheet Method</h1>
<p>Another way of determining oneâ€™s skin type is by using a blotting paper. Gently pat a blotting paper throughout your face. Take the paper and hold it up on a visible amount of light to see through it.</p>

<p>If the paper picked up little to no oil at all, youâ€™re most likely to have dry skin. If the blotting paper is saturated with oil, then youâ€™re likely to have oily skin. And if the blotting paper shows a minimal amount of oil from your nose and forehead, then you might either have normal or combination skin.</p>

<p>Furthermore, if youâ€™re skin is more prone to inflamation and irritation then youâ€™re skin is likely to be sensitive. Like other skin types, sensitive skin is also a common skin type and issue however it is not a medical condition.</p>

<h1 id="different-skin-types">Different Skin Types</h1>

<h1 id="normal-skin">Normal Skin</h1>

<p>Normal skin type is neither too dry or too oily. It has balanced sebum production thatâ€™s why normal skin type do not experience breakouts too much.</p>

<p>The blood circulation in such skin type is good and normal skin do not react bad to new products or change in weather. The skin is very firm and has minimal fine lines and wrinkles.</p>

<p>Normal skin is a very good skin type however, people with such skin type may also have sensitivity, redness and aging.</p>
