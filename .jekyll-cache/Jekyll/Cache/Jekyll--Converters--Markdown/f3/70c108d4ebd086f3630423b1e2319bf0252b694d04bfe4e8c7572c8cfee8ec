<h1 id="why-is-it-the-talk-of-the-town">Why is it the talk of the town?</h1>
<p>The most common skin issues people have to face are acne,rosacea, pigmentation, fine lines and wrinkles. There are many <a href="https://www.sheenycare.com/active-ingredients-for-skin-care/" rel="dofollow" target="_blank">active ingredients</a> that target such skin issues. However, Niacinamide is claimed to be the <strong>“active ingredient”</strong> that targets all the skin issues at once and treat them.</p>

<p>Most of the studies about it have been carried out at concentrations of 5% or below. And yes, it can do everything it’s purported to: improve hyperpigmentation, fortify barrier function, normalize sebum production etc. However, we need to realize that niacinamide, and a whole host of other “actives” can do more harm than good when overused.</p>
