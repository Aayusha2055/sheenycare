<h1 id="what-is-niacinamide">What is Niacinamide?</h1>
<p>Niacinamide is also known as nicotinamide, which is one of the two major forms of vitamin B3. Nicotamide is an essential water soluble vitamin. In short, it is not sythesized in our body and we need eat in order to recieve it‚Äôs benefits.</p>

<h1 id="why-is-vitamin-b3-an-essntial-nutrient-for-the-body">Why is Vitamin B3 an essntial nutrient for the body?</h1>
<p>Our body needs Vitamin B3 (niacinamide) because it helps to make neccessary environment for the cells to keep functioning in our body. It helps carry out various processes such as metabolism, damage repair etc.</p>

<p>Vitamin B3 is an essential nutrient for our body and its deficiency can lead us to several disorders of the skin, kidneys and brain. Hence, to prevent the deficiency of it, there are supplements of vitamin B3 available in the market.</p>

<h1 id="niacin-and-niacinamide">Niacin and Niacinamide</h1>
<p>The name seems quite similar but both of them are <a href="https://ww5.komen.org/BreastCancer/Niacinamide/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">two different types of Vitamin B3</a>. Since our body is unable to produce niacinamide on it‚Äôs own, taking niacin supplements can help the body make niacinamide. But this only happens when there is excessive amount of niacin in the body.</p>

<h1 id="how-do-we-get-vitamin-b3-from-foods">How do we get Vitamin B3 from foods?</h1>
<p>There are several good sources of Vitamin B3 in foods. We get them from several foods such as:</p>

  <li>Milk</li>
  <li>Eggs</li>
  <li>Green vegetables</li>
  <li>Beans and</li>
  <li>Cereal grains</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="benefits-of-using-niacinamide">Benefits of using Niacinamide.</h1>
<p>As said earlier, it is a form of vitamin B3. It is water soluble and unlike ceramide, our body doesn‚Äôt store it. Nevertheless, it has potential to imporve the skin in several ways.</p>

<p>The most common skin issues people have to face are acne,rosacea, pigmentation, fine lines and wrinkles. There are many <a href="https://www.sheenycare.com/active-ingredients-for-skin-care/" rel="dofollow" target="_blank">active ingredients</a> that target such skin issues. However, Niacinamide is claimed to be the <strong>‚Äúactive ingredient‚Äù</strong> that targets all the skin issues at once and treat them.</p>

<p>Most of the studies about it have been carried out at concentrations of 5% or below. And yes, it can do everything it‚Äôs purported to: improve hyperpigmentation, fortify barrier function, normalize sebum production etc. However, we need to realize that niacinamide, and a whole host of other ‚Äúactives‚Äù can do more harm than good when overused.</p>
