I"®<p>When our skin is either dry or oily, taking care of it is a pretty much straightforward process. But when you‚Äôve got a little bit of both, things start to get complicated. Hydrating creams are very hydrating, oil-absorbing masks are awfully absorbing, balancing lotions never seem to do much balancing, the irony! And that‚Äôs bad news for us. Combination skin is very tricky and confusing. Yes, it‚Äôs true rather frustrating than confusing.</p>

<p>Do you have the same confusion and frustration or you are trying to figure out what is a combination skin? Welcome Sister! You‚Äôre in for an enlightening reading session. Well then, put on your glasses and sip your water every time you read ‚ÄúCombination Skin‚Äù on this article or any other article.</p>

<h1 id="how-do-you-know-you-have-a-combination-skin">How do you know you have a combination skin?</h1>

<p>Here‚Äôs a Simple <a href="https://sheenycare.com/how-to-determine-my-skin-type" target="_blank">Test!</a>.</p>

<p>Wash your face and wait for 20 minutes, read some articles ( you can read our other articles too, just a heads up). Touch your T-Zone (forehead, nose, and chin), does it feel sticky or oily? Now touch the rest of your face, is it dry or normal, meaning not as oily as your T-zone?</p>

<p>If no, then you continue reading this post as it may have things you might want to try as your skin may not be a combination skin.</p>

<p>If yes, then sister.. you are welcome to the Combi-Bombi club! I know little over the top but who really cares, no?</p>

<h2 id="confusion-with-the-skin-products">Confusion With The Skin Products?</h2>

<p>Does it ever happen when you use a moisturiser for a normal skin, it makes your cheeks feel good, but your T-zone looks like an oil mine? We have all been there. Pat yourself, you have come a long way. Use products that are water-based and are pH balanced. Yes, you still need to moisturise, but use a lotion that combines mattifying ingredients (salicylic acid, silica) with oil-free hydrators (glycerin, hyaluronic acid). That‚Äôs a must for a combination skin!</p>

<h2 id="pores-did-anyone-say-pores">Pores? Did anyone say Pores?</h2>

<p>Trust me, if I hear and see anyone say I have large pores, I‚Äôm gonna take care of it. That should be your mindset. If you have pores on your T-Zone greater than the pores around your cheeks or chin then yes, you do have a combination skin! Though nothing has been proven to actually shrink pores, there is a way to make them look smaller. Dermatologists recommend applying products containing retinol, alpha hydroxy acid, or beta hydroxy acid, which help keep pores from getting clogged and at bay. Great news, isn‚Äôt it?</p>

<h2 id="does-it-snow-dandruffs">Does it snow? (Dandruffs)</h2>

<p>How often does it snow in your place? Often? Not quite? Snow as in Dandruff, gals. You are most likely to have dandruffs and have dry, flaky patches on your scalp. It isn‚Äôt a definite indicator but yeah most people tend to have the problem. Use a better and anti-dandruff shampoo to get rid of your snow.</p>

<h2 id="dry-patches-and-breakouts">Dry Patches and Breakouts?</h2>

<p>Tell me about another greater duo beside the guys above. Having a Combi-Bombi Skin, breakouts along with dry patches are the worst thing that can happen to anyone. Use two types of masks, a moisturising and a mattifying one. They can help you with the troubles. Use a clay mask if it‚Äôs available.</p>

<h2 id="hows-the-weather">How‚Äôs the weather?</h2>

<p>The skin mostly reacts to the environment around where you spend most of your time. If it‚Äôs hotter you‚Äôll be a glistening god/goddess by mid morning. Always use a blotting paper to avoid having excess oil from your personal oil mine.. kidding!</p>

<h2 id="dry-patches-around-your-t-zone">Dry Patches around your T-Zone?</h2>

<p>If they have a little bit of yellowness to them, and the skin underneath looks pink and inflamed, you may have seborrheic dermatitis. This condition is often confused with dry skin, but it is an overgrowth of yeast that normally grows on the scalp. People often have dandruff along with it. To clear it up, see your dermatologist, who may prescribe antifungal, anti-yeast, or anti-inflammatory creams.</p>

<p>These signs have truth in them, if you have any signs from above. You‚Äôre mostly having a combination skin. If you want to know further more about the skin you have, it‚Äôs always the better option to visit your dermatologist and get a clear vision about your skin!</p>
