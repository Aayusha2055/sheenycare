I"<p>I have seen plenty of people struggling with their skin. People my age here in Nepal seem to forever struggle with acne and pores. However, women after pregnancy seem to struggle with both acne as well hyperpigmentation. Despite the skin care study having discovered multiple ingredients that deal with several skin problems, people still seem to be unaware of what actually works for their skin. And that is why skin care has become so important to me that it made me curious of all that there is to research and know about it.</p>
