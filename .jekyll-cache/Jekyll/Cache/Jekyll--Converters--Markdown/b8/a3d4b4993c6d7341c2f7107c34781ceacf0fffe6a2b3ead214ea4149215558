I"R<p>If you are a skin enthusiast you must have heard or read somewhere about this magical substance named Hyaluronic Acid!
Putting it simply, Hyaluronic acid is the key to instantly plumping fine lines and making skin look all glowy.
It can be found in everything from serums to sheet masks, but what exactly is it?
Here are some insights to Hyaluronic Acid including the right way to incorporate it into your skincare routine.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-hyaluronic-acid">What is Hyaluronic Acid?</h1>
<p>Hyaluronic acid (HA) is actually a sugar present naturally in our skin that holds water and helps keep it hydrated.
The Hyaluronic Acid within our bodies holds a thousand times its weight in water. It retains all that moisture in our skin and joints. It also prevents all that moisture from evaporating into the air.
Cool, right? Just like collagen and elastin, the amount of naturally-occurring hyaluronic acid in our bodies decreases as we get older.
There are, however, ways to help stimulate the production of HA in our bodies.
Balanced Diet
Antioxidants
Water</p>

<h1 id="hyaluronic-acid-is-a-super-humectant">Hyaluronic Acid is a Super Humectant!</h1>
<p>Hyaluronic acid brings moisture to the surface of your skin when used in skin care products like creams and serums.
It can be used as a humectant in your skincare routine because of its ability to hold water. Hence, it continually keeps the skin moisturized throughout the day.</p>

<h1 id="pairing-ha-with-other-ingredients">Pairing HA with other Ingredients!</h1>
<p>Hyaluronic acid plays well with most other ingredients and is great while pairing with chemical peels, retinol, vitamins, and other acids.
The only exception would be acids with low pH levels, like glycolic acid. It may pollute the HA and make it ineffective.</p>

<h1 id="picking-up-right-ha">Picking up right HA!</h1>
<p>Picking the right hyaluronic acid product is really tricky. The molecule is often times too large to effectively deliver hydration deep into skin layers.
The molecule is micronized i.e. it penetrates the skin in order to be effective.
Otherwise, you are just putting it on top of the skin without it being helpful, obviously!</p>

<h1 id="is-ha-injectable">Is HA Injectable?</h1>
<p>Trust me everyone is skeptical about injecting anything on their body. With a few pricks of a needle, the gel plumps sunken areas, smooths fine lines, and decreases shadows. Then, slowly the gel dissolves over time.
In fillers, HA is bound in a gel carrier that holds it in place where it is in use as an injection. The hyaluronic acid creates volume because it draws in water to the area, creating a filling effect. Still skeptical?</p>

<p><strong>Side effects</strong> are minimal: you may experience some swelling or bruising that can last for two or three days. The most important thing to remember when getting any kind of filler or injectable. Please go to a trained and board-certified dermatologist or plastic surgeon.</p>

<h1 id="why-is-ha-everyones-favorite">Why is HA everyoneâ€™s favorite?</h1>
<p>Hyaluronic acid is something our bodies already produce, itâ€™s considered to be safe for use in all types of injectables.
Take the liquid nose job, for example, dermatologists use filler to even out bumps in the nose and improve the shape, or even to improve foot pain in patients who have lost the cushioning in their heels. It can be injected into the feet to improve the padding on the bone and decrease pain.</p>

<p>Hyaluronic Acid has many benefits for your skin! For all skin types. If you want to learn about the magical stuff it does, you should definitely check-up with your near and dear Dermatologist.</p>
