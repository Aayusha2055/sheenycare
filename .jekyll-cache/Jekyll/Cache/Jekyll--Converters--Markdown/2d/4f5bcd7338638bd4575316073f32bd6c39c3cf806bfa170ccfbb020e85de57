<p>If you are a skin enthusiast you must have seen or heard or read somewhere about this magical substance named Hyaluronic Acid!</p>

<p>Putting it simply, Hyaluronic acid is the key to instantly plumping fine lines and making skin look all glowy. It can be found in everything from serums to sheet masks, but what exactly is it?</p>

<p>Here are some insights to Hyaluronic Acid including the right way to incorporate it into your skincare routine.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-hyaluronic-acid">What is Hyaluronic Acid?</h1>
<p>Hyaluronic acid (HA) is actually a sugar found naturally in our skin that holds water and helps keep it hydrated and plump. The HA within our bodies holds a thousand times its weight in water to not only retain all that moisture in our skin and joints but also prevent all that moisture from evaporating into the air.</p>

<p>Cool, right? Just like collagen and elastin, the amount of naturally-occurring hyaluronic acid in our bodies decreases as we get older. There are, however, ways to help stimulate the production of HA in our bodies.</p>

<h1 id="hyaluronic-acid-is-a-super-humectant">Hyaluronic Acid is a Super Humectant!</h1>

<p>Hyaluronic acid brings moisture to the surface of your skin when used in skin care products like creams and serums. it can be used as a humectant in your skincare routine because of its ability to draw and hold water. It continually keeps the skin moisturized throughout the day.</p>

<h1 id="pairing-hyaluronic-acid-with-other-ingredients">Pairing Hyaluronic Acid with other Ingredients!</h1>
<p>A lot of controversies on parabens are not backed by enough research and facts. Research upto date hasnâ€™t showed adverse effect by paraben on humans. As said earlier, definitive evidence of harm is lacking.</p>

<h1 id="picking-up-right-hyaluronic-acid">Picking up right Hyaluronic Acid!</h1>
<p>Picking the right hyaluronic acid product is really tricky. The molecule is oftentimes too large to effectively deliver hydration deep into skin layers. The molecule is micronized i.e. it penetrates the skin in order to be effective. Otherwise, you are just putting it on top of the skin without it being helpful, obviously!</p>

<h1 id="is-hyaluronic-acid-injectable">Is Hyaluronic Acid Injectable?</h1>
<p>Trust me everyone is skeptical about injecting anything on their body. With a few pricks of a needle, the gel plumps sunken areas, smooths fine lines, and decreases shadowsâ€”then slowly dissolves over the course of one year.</p>

<p>In fillers, hyaluronic acid is bound in a gel carrier which holds it in place where it is injected. The hyaluronic acid creates volume because it draws in water to the area, creating a filling effect. Still skeptical?</p>
