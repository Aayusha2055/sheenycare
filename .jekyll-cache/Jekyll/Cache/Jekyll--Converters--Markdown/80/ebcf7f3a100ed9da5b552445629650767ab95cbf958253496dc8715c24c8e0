I"ï<p>If you are a skin enthusiast you must have seen or heard or read somewhere about this magical substance named Hyaluronic Acid!</p>

<p>Putting it simply, Hyaluronic acid is the key to instantly plumping fine lines and making skin look all glowy. It can be found in everything from serums to sheet masks, but what exactly is it?</p>

<p>Here are some insights to Hyaluronic Acid including the right way to incorporate it into your skincare routine.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-hyaluronic-acid">What is Hyaluronic Acid?</h1>
<p>Hyaluronic acid (HA) is actually a sugar found naturally in our skin that holds water and helps keep it hydrated and plump. The HA within our bodies holds a thousand times its weight in water to not only retain all that moisture in our skin and joints but also prevent all that moisture from evaporating into the air.</p>

<p>Cool, right? Just like collagen and elastin, the amount of naturally-occurring hyaluronic acid in our bodies decreases as we get older. There are, however, ways to help stimulate the production of HA in our bodies.</p>

<p><strong>Cancer:</strong> Parabens are suspected to have caused cancer on several people. Precisely, breast cancer.</p>

<p><strong>Endocrine disruptor:</strong> Endocrine disruptors, also known as hormonally active agents, endocrine disrupting chemicals, or endocrine disrupting compounds are chemicals that can interfere with endocrine (or hormonal) systems. These disruptions can cause cancerous tumors, birth defects, and other developmental disorders. Current literature suggests that parabens act as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), with estrogenic effects reported most often.</p>

<p><strong>Decreased sperm count:</strong> Men with high concentrations of paraben also had a larger proportion of sperm with what‚Äôs known as abnormal morphology, or unusual size or shape, that‚Äôs associated with infertility.</p>

<p><strong>Prenatal Exposure:</strong> Prenatal Exposure is a medical condition, where a fetus inside a women‚Äôs womb is exposed to unwanted factors such as drugs, radiation, chemical etc.</p>

<p><strong>Mood Diruptor:</strong> Parabens can act like the hormone estrogen in the body and disrupt the normal function of hormone systems.</p>

<p><strong>Environmental Issues:</strong> Parabens have been detected in surface waters, fish and sediments as low levels of butylparaben can kill coral, according to laboratory tests (Danaovaro 2008).</p>

<h1 id="facts-about-parabens">Facts About Parabens!</h1>
<p>A lot of controversies on parabens are not backed by enough research and facts. Research upto date hasn‚Äôt showed adverse effect by paraben on humans. As said earlier, definitive evidence of harm is lacking.</p>

<p>On the other hand, many <u>studies confirms safe usage of parabens</u>. It is said that paraben is able to penetrate deep into the skin but studies show that <u>systematic contact to dermatitis from ingestion is rare</u>.</p>

<p>Paraben has been used for several years now and it seems to have <u>low toxicity</u> than what it is assumed of. It is actually very <u>cheap</u> these days given that the <u>chemical is very stable i.e. it doesn't react</u>.</p>

<p>It has <u>low rate of allergies</u> compared to other preservatives. The allergy rate of paraben is only at <u>0.06%</u>.</p>

<h1 id="so-should-we-buy-skin-care-products-with-parabens-in-them">So, should we buy skin care products with parabens in them?</h1>
<p>Since there aren‚Äôt enough studies that prove parabens are harmful, what is the ‚Äúparaben free‚Äù fuss really about?</p>

<p>The <u>Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR)</u>, in partnership with the FDA, concluded that parabens are safe to be used in cosmetics. However, all the controversies that have been build up throughout the years about paraben has made people choose paraben free products.</p>

<p>If you still have products with parabens in them, don‚Äôt waste it and rather use it.
