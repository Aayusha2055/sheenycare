<h1 id="what-is-niacinamide">What is Niacinamide?</h1>
<p>Niacinamide is also known as Nicotinamide. It is one of the two major forms of vitamin B3. Nicotamide is an essential water soluble vitamin i.e. it is not synthesized in our body and we need to eat it in order to receive it’s benefits.</p>

<h1 id="why-is-vitamin-b3-an-essential-nutrient-for-the-body">Why is Vitamin B3 an essential nutrient for the body?</h1>
<p>Our body needs Vitamin B3 (niacinamide) because it helps to make the necessary environment for the cells to keep functioning in our body. It helps carry out various processes such as metabolism, damage repair etc.</p>

<p>Vitamin B3 is an essential nutrient for our body and its deficiency can lead us to several disorders of the skin, kidneys and brain. Hence, to prevent the deficiency of it, there are supplements of vitamin B3 available in the market.</p>

<p>There is a lot research going on about this ingredient. However, the mechanism by which Vitamin B3 works in the skin is not identified completely. You should always get a prescription from the doctor before buying supplements for yourself.</p>

<p>Despite that, Niacinamide in skin care has a lot of clinical benefits when applied topically. Nowadays, it has been a promised active ingredient to help manage acne, rosacea, pigmentation issues, and wrinkles.</p>

<h1 id="niacin-and-niacinamide">Niacin and Niacinamide</h1>
<p>The name seems quite similar but both of them are <a href="https://ww5.komen.org/BreastCancer/Niacinamide/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">two different types of Vitamin B3</a>. Since our body is unable to produce niacinamide on it’s own, taking niacin supplements can help the body make niacinamide. But this only happens when there is an excessive amount of niacin in the body.</p>

<h1 id="how-do-we-get-vitamin-b3-from-foods">How do we get Vitamin B3 from foods?</h1>
<p>There are several good sources of Vitamin B3 in foods. We get them from several foods such as:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Yeast</li>
  <li>Meat</li>
  <li>Fish</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
  <li>Eggs</li>
  <li>Green vegetables</li>
  <li>Beans and</li>
  <li>Cereal grains</li>
</ol>

<p>Although we’re probably getting Vitamin B3 from our diet we do not know whether it does go into our skin or not.</p>

<h1 id="what-does-niacinamide-do-for-the-skin">What does Niacinamide do for the skin?</h1>
<p>As said earlier, it is a form of vitamin B3. It is water soluble and unlike ceramide, our body doesn’t store it. Nevertheless, using Niacinamide in skin care has many potential to improve the skin.</p>

<h2 id="1-it-stimulates-skin-barrier">1. It stimulates skin barrier:</h2>
<p>Skin barrier is the outer surface of the skin. Niacinamide strengthens the skin barrier and increases its resiliency i.e. increases the ability of the skin to recover from any damages.</p>

<h2 id="2-it-stimulates-lipid-barrier">2. It stimulates lipid barrier:</h2>
<p>When Niacinamide is applied in the skin, it helps the skin grow a lipid barrier. This lipid is made up of ceramide, which in turn helps retain moisture and hydrates the skin. Hence, if you have extremely dry skin or if your skin is mature then Niacinamide is a must for you.</p>

<h2 id="3-it-increases-the-immunity-of-the-skin">3. It increases the immunity of the skin:</h2>

<h2 id="7-it-minimizes-the-visibility-of-fine-lines-and-wrinkles">7. It minimizes the visibility of fine lines and wrinkles:</h2>
<p>Similarly, using the same concentration of Niacinamide has also shown to prevent premature signs of aging, that specifically comes along with sun damage. This includes, reducing the visibility of fine lines and wrinkles.</p>

<h2 id="8-it-regulates-the-oil-production">8. It regulates the oil production:</h2>
<p>Along with retaining moisture in the skin, Niacinamide regulates oil production. It controls the overproduction of oil in the sebaceous glands and prevents acne.</p>

<h2 id="9-it-prevents-acne">9. It prevents acne:</h2>
<p>Niacinamide has anti-inflammatory properties and it helps treat skin conditions like acne. Severe acne such as papules and pustules can be treated with 4% concentration of Niacinamide.
