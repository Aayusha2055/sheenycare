I"Â<p>The demography of people having combination skin is high and itâ€™s really super-common. Itâ€™s totally normal to be oily in some spots and dry in others and it may need slightly different care in different areas. Typically, thereâ€™s a mix of oily and dry areas on different parts of your face, with the t-zone (forehead, nose, and chin) being slightly too oily. I will try to include some of my favourites and no, theyâ€™re not sponsored ;)</p>
