<p>Use a very gentle but hydrating cleanser for about a minute to cleanse your skin.
Something as gentle as the <a href="https://www.amazon.in/Himalaya-Moisturizing-Aloe-Vera-200ml/dp/B074M3Z6Q5" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Himalaya moisturizing aloe vera face wash</a> is a blessing to your skin. And if you would want to steep a little high, opt for a <a href="https://www.cetaphil.com/us/products" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">cetaphil gentle skin cleanser</a>. Just make sure the product you‚Äôre using doesn‚Äôt let your skin feel tight and stripping after the wash.</p>
