<p>We have all seen and heard how dermatologists recommend <a href="https://www.cerave.com/skincare/cleansers/foaming-facial-cleanser" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser</a> for people with acne. It works to cleanse the skin and remove oil, without disrupting the skin’s protective barrier.</p>

<p>Also, it won’t clog pores or dry the skin out. The product contains niacin-amide (helps in dealing inflammation) and ceramides to help calm and moisturize irritated skin.</p>
