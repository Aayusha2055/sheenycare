I"ˆ<p>The demography of people having combination skin is high and itâ€™s really super-common. Itâ€™s totally normal to be oily in some spots and dry in others and it may need slightly different care in different areas. Typically, thereâ€™s a mix of oily and dry areas on different parts of your face, with the t-zone (forehead, nose, and chin) being slightly too oily. I will try to include some of my favourites and no, theyâ€™re not sponsored ;)</p>

<p>Well, that was some introduction to combination skin, wasnâ€™t it? Hi! I am a skin enthusiast! Here, talking about me, my skin is really dry around the cheeks and the eyes, it tends to get quite oily on the rest of my face which is known as T-zone( categorised as the part of our face, mapping from forehead to nose and for me my chin area too). I do have visible pores and having an oily skin does call for some breakout here and then. I tend to keep my skinâ€™s PH level balanced as much as I can. I never had an acne or any major pimples situation going on throughout my adolescence.</p>

<p>However, as I got to my 20â€™s, I can see how my skin is changing and I am now more indulged regarding my skin care. As I have seen a lot of videos and read a lot of articles regarding skin care. I have probably read and tried everything from my grandmotherâ€™s to momâ€™s to friendâ€™s and dermatologistâ€™s methods of keeping the skin healthy. I am very skeptical about my skin and I always try to do a lot of research before trying anything. Be it from anyone, literally anyone. So, I may have some ideas and tips for people who have Combination skin! Read along for some insights from me.</p>

<h1 id="hydration">Hydration</h1>
<p>Yeah, really. Water is really essential as if you were expecting anything else. Go sip your water, right now! Iâ€™m watching. Go, just do it. I am not going to tell you how important drinking water is for your healthy skin. Get that PH level balanced, babygirl.</p>

<h1 id="cleanser">Cleanser</h1>
<p>Start your day by washing your entire face with a gentle cleanser, there are lots of good brands in Nepal. Personally, I use Biotique Pineapple Foaming Face Wash every morning after I do oil pulling. Yeah, I know it sounds and feels not likely great but I vouch for it. I have seen good results. Lastly, I do recommend <u>VLCC's Chandan/Haldi</u> and <u>Kesar Gel Cleanser</u>. I just love how it smells!
At night, wash your face with the same mild cleanser and use an exfoliator (preferably Chemical Exfoliator) twice weekly.</p>

<h1 id="moisturiser">Moisturiser</h1>
<p>When we use a moisturiser for normal skin, our cheeks feel good, but our T-zone looks like an oil mine! I am sure we have all been there! But we still need to moisturise, using a lotion that combines mattifying ingredients (salicylic acid, silica) with oil-free hydrators (glycerin, hyaluronic acid) could be the saving grace. I use <u>Ahava- Essential Day Moisturiser</u> for Combination Skin! It really does work wonders.</p>

Neutrogena Hydro Boost City Shield SPF Moisturiser<br />
Clean &amp; Clear Oil-Free Moisturizer</p>

<h1 id="mask">Mask</h1>
<p>What an absolute treasure! To deep-treat combination skin, use a clay mask on oily areas to draw out excess sebum, dirt, and makeup to prevent breakouts and blackheads from appearing. I use <u>Lotus Herbals Claywhite Face Pack</u>. Itâ€™s good.
Once a week, just indulge yourself in a spot-treating face with two masks. Apply a moisturising mask to the dry areas and an oil-absorbing clay one to your T-zone. I personally love masks! I just loveâ€™em. The face before and after the mask face really gives it away.<br />
<b>Note:</b> You can use the oil-absorbing mask up to three times a week.</p>

<h1 id="retinol">Retinol</h1>
<p>I donâ€™t know where I would be without using Retinol based serum. When you have combination skin, finding a serum that wonâ€™t sway your complexion to the extremes of oily or dry can be tricky. To play on the safe side, opt for a retinol based one â€“ the ingredient plays well with both dry and oily skin, keeping dry patches at bay while helping to prevent clogged pores. When using a retinoid in the daytime, always follow up your retinol serum with SPF. ALWAYS! I have yet to try The Ordinary Retinol Serum - The Ordinary Granactive Retinoid. I will let you know how I feel about it.</p>

RETINOL SERUM: THE ORDINARY GRANACTIVE RETINOID</p>

<h1 id="blotting-papers">Blotting Papers</h1>
<p>When the weather is hot, your T-zone tends to get shiny faster than it normally wouldâ€”usually by midmorning. The quickest solution: blotting papers</p>

<p><strong>Honorable Mention:</strong><br />
Clean &amp; Clear Oil Absorbing Sheets</p>

<p>Itâ€™s tricky and itâ€™s very important to know how to use the right products for the right areas. Also, you donâ€™t have to have an expensive skin care routine to have the best skin! Thereâ€™s quite an understatement for affordable brands that work wonders for your skin. I will try to include some of them and no, itâ€™s not sponsored.</p>
