I"±<p>The paraben-free label is slapped into most of the skin care brands and cosmetics products. But do you really know what is paraben and is it really harmful? Let‚Äôs dig into it.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-paraben">What is Paraben?</h1>
<p>Parabens are common preservative used in personal care products as well as food. The basic use of preservative is used to expand the shelf life of a product. That is how the paraben works in skin care products. It prevents the growth of mold, fungus and bacteria in the skin care products.</p>

<p><u>Methyl Paraben</u>, <u>Ethyl Paraben</u>, <u>Propyl Paraben</u> and <u>Butyl Paraben</u> are some examples of parabens.</p>

<p><strong>Cancer:</strong> Parabens are suspected to have caused cancer on several people. Precisely, breast cancer.</p>

<p><strong>Endocrine disruptor:</strong> Endocrine disruptors, also known as hormonally active agents, endocrine disrupting chemicals, or endocrine disrupting compounds are chemicals that can interfere with endocrine (or hormonal) systems. These disruptions can cause cancerous tumors, birth defects, and other developmental disorders. Current literature suggests that parabens act as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), with estrogenic effects reported most often.</p>

<p><strong>Decreased sperm count:</strong> Men with high concentrations of paraben also had a larger proportion of sperm with what‚Äôs known as abnormal morphology, or unusual size or shape, that‚Äôs associated with infertility.</p>

<p><strong>Prenatal Exposure:</strong> Prenatal Exposure is a medical condition, where a fetus inside a women‚Äôs womb is exposed to unwanted factors such as drugs, radiation, chemical etc.</p>

<p><strong>Mood Diruptor:</strong> Parabens can act like the hormone estrogen in the body and disrupt the normal function of hormone systems.</p>

<p><strong>Environmental Issues:</strong> Parabens have been detected in surface waters, fish and sediments as low levels of butylparaben can kill coral, according to laboratory tests (Danaovaro 2008).</p>

<h1 id="facts-about-parabens">Facts About Parabens!</h1>
<p>A lot of controversies on parabens are not backed by enough research and facts. Research upto date hasn‚Äôt showed adverse effect by paraben on humans. As said earlier, definitive evidence of harm is lacking.</p>

<p>On the other hand, many <u>studies confirms safe usage of parabens</u>. It is said that paraben is able to penetrate deep into the skin but studies show that <u>systematic contact to dermatitis from ingestion is rare</u>.</p>

<p>Paraben has been used for several years now and it seems to have <u>low toxicity</u> than what it is assumed of. It is actually very <u>cheap</u> these days given that the <u>chemical is very stable i.e. it doesn't react</u>.</p>

<p>It has <u>low rate of allergies</u> compared to other preservatives. The allergy rate of paraben is only at <u>0.06%</u>.</p>

<h1 id="so-should-we-buy-skin-care-products-with-parabens-in-them">So, should we buy skin care products with parabens in them?</h1>
<p>Since there aren‚Äôt enough studies that prove parabens are harmful, what is the ‚Äúparaben free‚Äù fuss really about?</p>

<p>The <u>Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR)</u>, in partnership with the FDA, concluded that parabens are safe to be used in cosmetics. However, all the controversies that have been build up throughout the years about paraben has made people choose paraben free products.</p>

<p>If you still have products with parabens in them, don‚Äôt waste it and rather use it.
