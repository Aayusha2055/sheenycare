I"(<p>To have oily skin is as normal as having skin. It is not a skin condition, rather a skin type. To <a href="https://www.sheenycare.com/how-to-determine-my-skin-type/" target="_blank">determine</a> whether you have oily skin or not is super easy. In fact, you know it already when you’re skin is oily. That is because you feel greasy all the time.</p>

<p>Having oily skin is indeed a challenge because the possibility of skin issues is endless. You can have pores, you can have severe breakouts, acne can be your best friend and so many issues that need proper treatment and care. This is why you need a skincare routine that works both for you and your oily skin.</p>

<p>But before that, you need to understand what oily skin is, what are its symptoms, and the possible skin types people with oily skin may have.</p>

<h1 id="what-causes-oily-skin">What causes oily skin?</h1>
<p>There are several factors that cause the skin to be oily. Genetics, hormones, age, stress, diet choices, using the wrong skincare products, or even the climate in which you live can result in your skin is oily.</p>

<p>Oily skin type always seems to be glowing. The reason behind this being the greasiness due to constant sebum (natural oil) production. If the production of sebum increases, the oil glands increases in size as well. Thus, the size of our pores is increased. Meanwhile, all those oil sits on the surface of the skin.</p>

<p>But since the skin is ours, we have full power to take it under our control. And we can do it with a proper skin care routine for oily skin.</p>

<h1 id="skin-care-routine-for-oily-skin">Skin Care Routine For Oily Skin</h1>
<p>The morning routine for people with oily skin is made up of four easy steps. These steps will keep your skin healthy, clear, and shine-free.</p>

<h2 id="step-1-cleanse">Step 1: Cleanse:</h2>

<p><strong>Morning:</strong> Cleansing the skin is the most important step in any skin care routine. Unlike dry skin, people with oily skin types must use a proper cleanser to clean their skin in the morning. Dirt, impurities and excess oil, can build up in your skin overnight and they clog pores. Hence, a proper and gentle cleanser is must for people of oily skin type.</p>

<p><strong>Evening:</strong> While cleaning once in the morning is okay for the skin, you need to double cleanse in the evening. Start by using a cleansing oil to remove any makeup or SPF and sebum of the day. Following the first step, use a gentle foam or gel cleanser to remove any traces of makeup and clean deep into your pores.</p>

<p>While choosing a cleanser for oily skin, make sure:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It has a gel-like texture,</li>
  <li>doesn’t strip natural oils, and</li>
  <li>targets hyperpigmentation and acne.</li>
</ul>

<p>People with oily skin generally use cleansers with “Salicylic Acid”. The BHA deep cleanses the pores and help clear away excess oil and dead skin cells.</p>

<h2 id="step-2-tone">Step 2: Tone:</h2>

<p><strong>Morning:</strong> Toning the skin is another important step after cleaning for people of oily skin type. Toner helps remove dirt or any residue left on the face after cleansing. It also prepares the skin for better absorption of products that need to be layered afterward. Look for a toner that contains hydrating ingredients like aloe vera, ginseng, or hyaluronic acid.</p>

<p>A good toner will help balance the oiliness in the skin without drying it out.</p>

<p><strong>Evening:</strong> The toner you choose for the evening should be more potent than the one used in AM. Potent toner helps tighten the pores as well as remove oils and dirt accumulated in the skin throughout the day.</p>

<p>While choosing a toner for oily skin, make sure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It has AHA (Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid, etc) for topical exfoliation, and</li>
  <li>BHA (Salicylic Acid) for deep exfoliation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using toners with active ingredients will refine your skin’s texture and help minimize the pores. Simultaneously, it will help balance the moisture of the skin.</p>

<h2 id="step-3-targeted-treatments">Step 3: Targeted Treatments:</h2>

<p>This step depends on what skin concern you are trying to treat. Based on that, you have to determine what serums, essence, or ampoules you need to invest in.</p>

<p>People with oily skin may have severe acne, fine lines and wrinkles, hyperpigmentation, and many more skin concerns. One of the major concerns to tackle still being balanced oil production. Moreover, even if your skin is oily, it doesn’t mean it is hydrated as well.</p>

<p>Hence, if you feel you’re skin needs hydration, then you need to use a hydrating serum. If you want to balance oil production, you need to use an oil-based serum. Similarly, if you want to fight fine lines and wrinkles, you need to use anti-aging serums.</p>

<h2 id="best-treatment-for-oily-skin-retinol">Best treatment for oily skin: Retinol</h2>
<p>Dermatologist swear by this treatment and it is by far the best treatment for oily skin. Oily skin can tolerate retinol the best. It should be applied at night and slowly introduced in your skin care routine. Start using it two or three times a week for the first month. It is a drying ingredient so go slow with this product and gradually increase the use.</p>

<h2 id="step-4-moisturize">Step 4: Moisturize:</h2>
<p>Moisturizing is very crucial for people with oily skin. There is some weird myth that if you have oily skin, you don’t need to or shouldn’t moisturize, which is completely wrong.</p>

<p>All skin types need moisturizer, but if you have oily skin, you should be more careful with what kind of moisturizer you’re using.</p>

<p>While choosing a moisturizer for oily skin, make sure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It is lightweight,</li>
  <li>free of oil,</li>
  <li>water-based and</li>
  <li>absorbs easily.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are the four-step skin care routine you can use in the morning and evening to keep your skin healthy, clear, and grease-free. Once, you’re done with these steps, all you need to do is add an SPF as the last step of morning skin care routine.</p>

<h2 id="step-5-spf-am-only">Step 5: SPF (AM Only)</h2>
<p>This is the final step of skin care routine for oily skin. You should always a broad spectrum SPF every day right before you apply your makeup or heading outdoors.</p>

<!-- ## 2.1: Oily Skin with Clogged Pores and Severe Breakouts

<h1 id="skin-care-tip-for-oily-skin">Skin Care Tip For Oily Skin.</h1>

<h2 id="1-choose-the-right-products">1. Choose the right products:</h2>

<p>If you have oily skin, products with mineral oil, petrolatum, and alcohol-based should be avoided. Also, while choosing products, one should always choose the “non-comedogenic” ones, which would not clog pores.</p>

<p>Oil-free moisturizers work great for such skin types. Chemical exfoliators tend to be gentle and they unclog the pores, hence, minimize breakouts. Clay masks also soothe the inflammation and control the oil in the skin.</p>

<p>Also, cleanse your skin twice a day rather than over-cleaning as drying out your pores can cause them to produce even more oil.</p>

<h2 id="2-manage-sleep-and-stress-level">2. Manage sleep and stress level:</h2>

<p>Skin health is directly proportional to sleep and stress levels. You should always be able to find time to relax, exercise, meditate and sleep. Lack of sleep and stress causes hormonal imbalances, which will affect skin health.</p>

<h2 id="3-eat-proper-diet">3. Eat proper diet:</h2>

<p>Oily skin is caused by high sebum production. We can control excess sebum production by eating a diet high in antioxidants. You can include a lot of veggies and less amount of sugar and animal products in your diet. Change of diet can reduce oiliness in the skin.</p>
