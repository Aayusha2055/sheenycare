I"Ä<p>When our skin is either dry or oily, taking care of it is a pretty much straightforward process. But when youâ€™ve got a little bit of both, things start to get complicated. Hydrating creams are very hydrating, oil-absorbing masks are awfully absorbing, balancing lotions never seem to do much balancing, the irony! And thatâ€™s bad news for us. Combination skin is very tricky and confusing. Yes, itâ€™s true rather frustrating than confusing.</p>
