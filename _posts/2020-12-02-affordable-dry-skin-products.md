Hello readers, today I am writing on dry skin yet again and if you have one, I can completely understand you. I too have dry skin, well yes, severely dry. I have been struggling with this condition for way too long. Like everyone else, I too google how to get rid of dry skin the winter or about the best skincare for dry skin and whatnot.

But then you must be saying, “Oh, what is she even talking about, she is a skincare blogger, she must have great skin!”. I’m afraid I don’t because my skin sucks as well. As a skincare blogger, I care for my skin but in reality, my skin is as messed up as everyone else’s. Well, my condition is genetic and nothing actually works for me other than constant care and effort.

If your <a href="https://www.sheenyskincare.com/how-to-determine-my-skin-type/" target="_blank">skin is dry</a> or if you wish to find it out, then you have landed in the right place. You can also read about building the <a href="https://www.sheenyskincare.com/what-is-dry-skin/" target="_blank">best skin care routine</a> for dry skin and enhance your knowledge on this scope. Now let’s get on with products that generally work for dry skin.

## Best skincare products for dry skin.

### 1. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GC74LL5/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=sheenycare-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=39cb6a2561603724e63ea0bf03976d5b&creativeASIN=B07GC74LL5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser ($11.55)</a>
Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser can be used daily to gently clean, hydrate, and soothe dry, sensitive skin. I have been using it ever since I came to know about it. This gentle face wash is suitable for all skin types but it is ideal for dry, sensitive skin. The formula is pH balanced, fragrance-free, and hypoallergic. The one thing that made love this product was the fact that it is gentle enough to use with or without water. It is a product recommended by dermatologist and even I recommend you to use it.

### 2. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MSSDEPK/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=sheenycare-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=4cba6458ea95de36dab25f8fe88aac73&creativeASIN=B01MSSDEPK" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser ($14.64)</a>
Remember when Cerave was super hyped? Like everyone was talking about it. Every dermatologist on Instagram and TikTok was going crazy about it, skincare estheticians couldn’t stop recommending it? That is when I decided to buy one no matter what.

This gentle cleansing lotion contains <a href="https://www.sheenyskincare.com/hyaluronic-acid-skin-benefits-uses" target="_blank">hyaluronic acid</a>, essential <a href="https://www.sheenyskincare.com/what-is-ceramide" target="_blank">ceramides</a>, and glycerin to help hydrate skin without stripping out the moisture. It helps in removing makeup, dirt, and excess oil. It also provides 24-hour hydration and leaves a moisturized, non-greasy feel as it has lotion-like consistency which makes the skin feel smooth as it cleanses.

### 3. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BSV1T35/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=sheenycare-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=ba53b295b793f08672bb8aa804fef511&creativeASIN=B07BSV1T35" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Banila Clean It Zero ($17.54)</a>

Oil cleansers is a good alternative to micellar water. This double cleansing technique is the best thing I have learned ever since I indulged myself in skincare.

I personally love using oil in my skincare routine and this oil cleanser dissolves any product we use on our face, resulting in a clear skin after washing off. Furthermore, Banila’s clean it zero is my favorite. Its main ingredients are emulsifying alcohol and palm oil, and it doesn’t leave residue on the skin.

This one is not actually fragrance free and if you’re sensitive to fragrances, handle this product with care.

### 4. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IDWP4IA/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=sheenycare-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=11431687f883e563a60b468eaa82e757&creativeASIN=B00IDWP4IA" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">InstaNatural Vitamin C Serum ($16.75)</a>

I have said this so many times, and I will repeat it, that I love <a href="https://www.sheenyskincare.com/hyaluronic-acid-skin-benefits-uses" target="_blank">Hyaluronic Acid</a>  in my Vitamin C. In fact both of this ingredient are a must in anyone’s skincare routine well when you get them both together you should click the buy now button. This was the first and special ingredient I added to my skincare routine after I turned 18.

### 5. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086LJQNB2/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=sheenycare-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=c7051c06b2db4419f8f089153a27f3f1&creativeASIN=B086LJQNB2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream ($12.88)</a>
I have been complementing cetaphil everywhere and that’s because I have been using their range since a very long time. One of the reasons why I am still using it is because their products are effective yet non-irritating.

Cetaphil moisturizing cream provides immediate and lasting 24-hour relief from dry to very dry skin. It completely restores the skin barrier in a week and binds water to the skin. Therefore, it prevents moisture loss in the skin to hydrate and protect skin from dryness.

### 6. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RK4HST7/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=sheenycare-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=e409f50f737201d80c4cf1320bea514e&creativeASIN=B07RK4HST7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion for Dry Skin ($17.78)</a>
Cerave and fine wine are the same. The more the merrier. Fine wine also have some excellent properties and can contribute to healthy skin but Cerave indeed is one of a kind. It has a smooth, light-weight texture which is quickly absorbed by our skin. It even contains Hyaluronic Acid to help retain natural moisture and ceramides to help restore and maintain the skin's natural barrier.

### 7. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N9SPQHQ/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=sheenycare-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=5191eb7e2676d7ad7d56198e652ce591&creativeASIN=B01N9SPQHQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">La Roche Posay Toleriane Ultra Cream ($14.99)</a>

I first tried this moisturizer when I once in a while have an urge to try products that I have never used before. My friend from Australia sent me a package of La Roche Posay and well I have turned to absolutely love it. I even recommend this to people with oily skin because the formulation is too good be true for all skin types.

This face moisturizer provides up to 48-hour hydration and helps restore skin’s barrier. It is also non comodogenic i.e it won’t clog pores. It is formulated with a high concentration of Prebiotic Thermal Water, Ceramide-3, Niacinamide & Glycerin.

### 8. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071WJWSRS/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=sheenycare-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=6bdddbdd52bc5ad19535076f27bd317b&creativeASIN=B071WJWSRS" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid ($12.00)</a>
Well finally we come down to the holy grail skin care ingredient for dry skin. Hyaluronic Acid is one of the best ingredient for dry skin and my personal favourite is the one from the ordinary. Now, what we need to understand yet again is that Hyaluronic Acid is not a moisturizing ingredient rather it is an hydrating ingredient.

Our body naturally produces it but with age the amount of natural HA decrease in our body and that is why we need to apply it topically. This product is also formulated with Vitamin B5 which also enhances the surface of the hydration. 

We find many products in the market these days which claims to have HA in them. However, HA is too large molecule to penetrate the skin and instead stays on the top of the skin. This is why our skin feels smooth and soft after the application.

### 9. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KLY4RYG/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=sheenycare-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=eb51c37ebcb88abe714387579515625e&creativeASIN=B07KLY4RYG" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CeraVe 100% Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50 ($13.99)</a>

This mineral-based sunscreen, also known as a physical sunscreen, reflects UVA/UVB rays to protect the skin. It contains three essential ceramides that help restore the skin’s natural barrier and lock in moisture long after application. The product is oxybenzone free, oil free, paraben free, fragrance free, chemical-filter free as well as non-comodogenic.

### 10. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000EPA4GQ/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=sheenycare-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=ab7309e43e4d9997ee6340578126dc4d&creativeASIN=B000EPA4GQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunscreen ($7.97)</a>

I use Neutrogen's Sheer Dry Touch Sunscreen everyday. This sunscreen helps defend the skin against the sign of aging. Furthermore, it prevents sunburn and decreases the risk of skin cancer when used as directed. It also protects the skin from UVA & UVB rays & antioxidant complex protects it from damaging free radicals.

The product doesn't leave any white cast and furthermore is fragnance free. The product is non-comodogenic and well less is more. 

Well my mom also started using this under my influence and she thinks that using this sunscreen has helped to lighten pigmentation on her face.
