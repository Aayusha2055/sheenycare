Have you ever felt like your skin was on the worst side of the sun and it didn't even matter what shirt you were wearing? 

Maybe you've been told to wear light clothing and have suffered the burn, or maybe you just didn't feel like spending money on a specific brand of sunscreen. 

Well, here's my story: I knew summer was around the corner and I had to visit my dermatologist.

I finally made an appointment last Sunday. She then prescribed me one the best sunscreens for the face. 

That made me think maybe sunscreen could probably be the solution to your messed-up life too and perhaps a liter or two of water.

The list i've prepared is sunscreens that are suggested by my dermatologist. Let’s start with the basics and then we will get to the products.

One of the most important things people should understand is: <b>regardless of whether we need sunscreen.</b>

The sun doesn’t disappear all of a sudden when it’s gloomy or cloudy. The sun is there and so are its powerful UV rays. Applying and reapplying sunscreen will prevent your skin from:

* Painful sunburns
* Skin cancer
* Premature signs of aging > dark spots and wrinkles.

After all, <b>an SPF is indeed a Sun Protection Factor.</b>

## How to choose the best sunscreen for your skin?
There’s nothing like the perfect sunscreen but there are categories however which make a specific sunscreen ideal for your skin.

<b>Look for a broad-spectrum sunscreen:</b> When buying a sunscreen, experts recommend an SPF 30 or higher. This ensures that the sunscreen you use will fight with the UVA and UVB's. Also, when you’re doing an outdoor activity, you must choose an SPF of 50 and higher.

<b>Find water-resistant sunscreens:</b> It's not about going for a swim, but water-resistant sunscreens will last long if you're sweating.

<b>Choose cream-based sunscreen:</b> There are many products available in the market. Today you can get sunscreens as a spray or stick or even like a loose powder. Despite the improvement in packaging, cream-based sunscreens are easy to use, they can be applied evenly and absorb better.

##  The Top 10 Sunscreens of 2021:
Now, let's get straight to the point. I have done my part and found the best 10 sunscreens of 2021, all recommended by board-specified dermatologists.

### 1. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002MSN3QQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B002MSN3QQ&linkCode=as2&tag=sheenycare-20&linkId=1e526858acebb8dcbe41505d70583d98">EltaMD UV Clear Facial Sunscreen SPF 46 | Sunscreen for Sensitive or Acne-Prone Skin</a>
When I was first taught about sunscreen by my mom, she gave me the Elta.

I, who was a complete beginner, used it and honestly liked it very much. When I further dug into the product, it was oil-Free and had mineral-based zinc oxide formula.

My mom knew about this sunscreen from her derm. This sunscreen specifically calms and protects sensitive skin types prone to acne, rosacea, and discoloration.

This sunscreen lotion is non-greasy, fragrance-free, oil-free, paraben-free, sensitivity-free, and noncomedogenic. It is available in tinted and untinted formulas for everyday UVA and UVB sun protection.

This sunscreen is always on my shelf, like always. Part of the reason I always have it is that it comes in my budget and works the same as the expensive ones.

Also, it is easily available, I must say. This product claims to defend against the signs of sun and decrease the risk of skin cancer caused by the sun when used as directed.

The best part about this product is that it has a non-greasy matte finish and is a non-comedogenic, paraben-free sunscreen.

This sunscreen is also available in both spray and stick form and can be used at the pool or in the ocean for up to 80 minutes of water resistance (linked below).

I remember using banana boat sunscreen as a child when going to swim. I would put tons and tons of it, layer it all over my body.

On my research, I found that this is still one of the most trusted brands, and people have been going back to this product. Even my brother who rarely puts moisturizer makes sure to use this when going to swim.

This sunscreen is clinically proven to provide UVA/UVB protection. It actually absorbs pretty quickly and won’t weigh you down.

It is designed for active and outdoor use so has a high-performance rate.

Since most of us use it before swimming, sweat and water are of no concern.
