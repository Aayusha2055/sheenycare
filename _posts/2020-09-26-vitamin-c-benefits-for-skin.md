# What is Vitamin C?

If you are interested in the skin care game, then you have likely heard about Vitamin C serums. Most of the skin care enthusiast and dermatologists recommend
the use of vitamin C. 

Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid and ascorbate, is a vitamin found in various foods and sold as a dietary supplement.

It is a vital molecule for skin health. It is an essential nutrient found in high levels in both the dermis & epidermis. However, it depletes as we age.


# How do we get Vitamin C from foods?
There are several good sources of vitamin C in foods. We get vitamin C from several foods such as:
1. Citrus fruits like Oranges
2. Pepper
3. Strawberry
4. Blackcurrants
5. Broccoli
6. Brussels sprouts
7. Potatoes etc.

Although we're probably getting Vitamin C from our diet we do not know whether it does go into our skin or not.

# Forms of Vitamin C in Skin Care
L-ascorbic acid is the purest and potent form of Vitamin C. It is one of the most important and commonly used <a href="https://www.sheenycare.com/active-ingredients-for-skin-care/" rel="dofollow" target="_blank">active ingredient</a> as it has a huge role in collagen synthesis.

The other less potent derivatives of L-ascorbic acid are:
1. Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate
2. Ascorbyl Palmitate
3. Ascorbyl Glucoside
4. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate
5. 3-O Ethyl Ascorbic Acid

While all the forms of Vitamin C have antioxidants, there are few formulas of vitamin C that works better than the other in skin care.
As said earlier, Ascorbic Acid, also known as the L-Ascorbic acid is the most studied form of vitamin C. When this formula is properly created below the pH level of 4(2.6 - 3.2) which is the ideal range, it helps create younger looking, firmir skin while fading dark spots, pigmentations and signs of uneven skin tone.

There are studies of Vitamin C with higher concerntration of upto 30% and have been used in the study of animal, maximum absorbtion was found with a 20% Vitamin C solution.

# Benefits of using Vitamin C Serum.
Now that we've known that Vitamin C is a highly beneficial antioxidant ingredient, it has plenty of other properties that helps both the skin and the body and deserves a permanent place in your skin care cabinets. Lets talk in depth about all the goodness of Vitamin C.

# 1. It suits all skin type:
Vitamin C is known to improve several skin issues but it is not limited to a skin type. Most people can easily use topical Vitamin C for a prolonged period of time, without having faced any reactions on the skin.

People with hypersensitive skin may experience irritation but perhaps this occurs in rare cases only.

# 2. It hydrates the skin:
Our skin is not properly hydrated in most of the cases. The reason behind this is very simple, we are top to bottom covered by the skin. Comprising 64% of water, your skin needs hydration.
Hence, one of the main vitamin C derivatives used in skin care called Magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, has been shown to help the skin retain water and prevent it from being too dry(dehydrated) or oily.

# 3. It brightens the skin:
Vitamin C helps fade pigmentation and reduce dullness of the skin, giving the skin a even tone and youthful glow.

# 4. It helps lighten pigmentation:
Hyperpigmentaion (sun-spots, age-spots and melasma) occurs when an enzyme called <a href="https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-is-melanin" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"></a>melanin is over produced in the skin. Hypepigmentaion can also occured in areas where acne has healed.

Vitamin C has shown to reduce the production of melanin in the skin and help fade dark spots leading to an even tone skin complexion.

# 5. It promotes collagen production:
Collagen is a naturally occuring protein that depletes over time. Vitamin C is well known for boosting collagen production in the skin. Lower level of collagen leads to fine lines and wrinkles.

The increase in collagen production has multiple advantages to the skin. This protein helps give skin that tight and plump look. Regular use of Vitamin C will slow down skin aging as it keeps producing enough collagen in the skin.

# 6. It lessens the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles:
Vitamin C protects the skin against any damages and help skin to regenerate. With additional hydration benefits and collagen stimulation, our skin neutralizes free radicals. Thus, lessening the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.

# 7. It revitalizes sun damaged skin
Over exposure of the skin to the sun has an adverse effect itself. We can observe skin issues such as flakiness, discolored patches (sunspots), rough areas, rosacea, etc. The damages by the sun are due to a molecule called free radicals. 

These are atoms but with missing elctrones. Hence, on their serach of electon, they steat it from our skin, causing a significant damage to the skin.

However, Vitamin C is rich in antioxidant and they protect the skin cells by giving an electron to these radicals.

# 8. It helps soothe sunburns
The effect of sunscreen is doubled when Vitamin C is layered underneath it. Hence, Vitamin C aids in calming the skin and increasing the cell turnover. Hence, the sunburnt skin is rejuvenated faster i.e it replaces the damaged cells with healthy new one.

# Who needs Vitamin C Serum?
**All skin type** needs Vitamin C. 

# How to use it?
Vitamin C can be used both in the AM and PM after cleansing the skin. Furthermore, it can also be layered with acids and <a href="https://www.sheenycare.com/what-is-niacinamide/" target="_blank">niacinamide</a>.
However, it can be irritating if used in a high percentage. Hence, if you are new to this ingredient, opt for a less potent derivative or lower percentage.

# Stability of Vitamin C Serum.
The stability of this ingredient depends on its formulation, preservatives used, and encapsulation. The reason behind this is because ascorbic acid easily oxidizes to dehydroascorbic acid when exposed to oxygen & light.

You can easily determine whether the product you have has oxidized or not by checking its color. If the color of the serum tends to be brown or orange from colorless, then it probably has been oxidized.

Oxidized vitamin c is likely to be less effective to the skin. In other words, formulas with water are stabilized using Ferulic Acid and Vitamin E to slow down the oxidization process. 

# How long does it take to work?
Research shows that Vitamin C starts working within **6 weeks** of application in the skin to treat **hyperpigmentation** and **hydrate the skin** whereas **12 weeks** to treat **fine lines and wrinkles**.
