Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid and ascorbate, is a vitamin found in various foods and sold as a dietary supplement.


L-ascorbic acid is the purest and potent form of Vitamin C. It is one of the most important and commonly used <a href="https://www.sheenycare.com/active-ingredients-for-skin-care/" rel="dofollow" target="_blank">active ingredient</a> as it has a huge role in collagen synthesis.

It is a vital molecule for skin health. It is an essential nutrient found in high levels in both the dermis & epidermis. However, it depletes as we age.

The other less potent derivatives of L-ascorbic acid are:
1. Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate
2. Ascorbyl Palmitate
3. Ascorbyl Glucoside
4. Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate
5. 3-O Ethyl Ascorbic Acid

# Benefits of using Vitamin C Serum.
1. It is known to have a role in collagen synthesis.
2. It is a potent antioxidant, protecting against pollutants & UV-induced damage by free radicals.
3. It brightens and evens skin tone.
4. It lessens the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.
5. It helps in lightening pigmentations.

# Stability of Vitamin C Serum.
The stability of this ingredient depends on its formulation, preservatives used, and encapsulation. The reason behind this is because ascorbic acid easily oxidizes to dehydroascorbic acid when exposed to oxygen & light.

You can easily determine whether the product you have has oxidized or not by checking its color. If the color of the serum tends to be brown or orange from colorless, then it probably has been oxidized.

Oxidized vitamin c is likely to be less effective to the skin. In other words, formulas with water are stabilized using Ferulic Acid and Vitamin E to slow down the oxidization process. 

# How long does it take to work?
Research shows that Vitamin C starts working within **6 weeks** of application in the skin to treat **hyperpigmentation** and **hydrate the skin** whereas **12 weeks** to treat **fine lines and wrinkles**.
