The skin is healthy, only if your skin barrier is strong. By using random products and mixing different skincare ingredients, you might disrupt the barrier of your skin.

Mixing skincare ingredients could be tricky right, cause it may make or break your skin. 

If you are new to skincare and you feel like the do’s and dons of skincare ingredients are complex and confusing, don’t you worry.

Read along to find out what skincare ingredients you shouldn't combine at all. 

## WHAT CAN YOU MIX WITH RETINOL?

I have been <a href="https://www.sheenyskincare.com/retinol-in-skin-care-uses-benefits/" rel="dofollow" target="blank">passionate about retinol</a> since day one and if you think retinol exfoliates the skin, or if it is a pigment lighter, then you are wrong. 

Retinol aka vitamin A increases the skin cell turnover i.e. it replaces existing skin cells by creating new skin cells.

Now think about the best time you can use it in your routine? It definitely suits best in your night skin care right?  

Yes, you may use it in the morning, but here's the deal. Retinol will make your skin extremely sensitive to sunlight. 

Hence, it's the most effective during the night. 

### Can you mix RETINOL with AHA’s (Glycolic, Mandelic, Lactic acid) and BHA’s (Salycilic Acid)?

Now that you know what retinol does, the worst thing you could do with your skin is mixing retinol with AHAs and BHAs. 

By <a href="https://www.sheenyskincare.com/what-is-salicylic-acid/" rel="dofollow" target="blank">reading a detail blog about AHA and BHA</a>, you can have more clarity on the subject matter.

The only thing this mixture is gonna do is make your skin extremely dry, irritated and disrupt your skin barrier.

Furthermore, it may cause excessive skin sensitivity, irritation, and redness.

### Can you mix RETINOL with Vitamin C?

Vitamin C is also known as ascorbic acid. Ahem, yes an acid. The <a href="https://www.sheenyskincare.com/vitamin-c-benefits-for-skin/" rel="dofollow" target="blank">benefits and uses of Vitamin C</a> goes a long way.

However, a simple example of why you should not mix retinol with vitamin c is:

Consider mixing oil with water. You need to understand that vitamin C is water soluble and retinol is oil soluble. 

Imagine mixing retinol and vitamin C and wishing it to be absorbed to create magic in the skin. Uh uh, does that even make sense to you?

Now that the term has been simplified, you know the rules right? That you must not mix acids with retinol.

### Can you mix RETINOL with Benzoyl Peroxide?

Benzoyl peroxide is an antibiotic and skin peeling agent. Retinol and benzoyl peroxides work almost the same. 

Hence, instead of increasing the effectiveness, mixing retinol and benzoyl peroxide cancels each other out.

Furthermore, it will make the skin extremely dry and irritated. You may also experience peeling, mild burning, stinging, scaling, swelling, and itching.

However, there is a formulation of adapalene (a third-generation topical retinoid) and benzoyl peroxide called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1300826061/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1300826061&linkCode=as2&tag=sheenycare-20&linkId=a0837ad6096abc90427c576d7b95a274">Epiduo</a>. This medicine is used to treat mild to moderate acne.

Hence, unless you have a third degree acne vulgaris, please do not use Epiduo without a prescription from a dermatologist.

## What can you mix with VITAMIN C?

I know this product has been a holy grail for most of us. To be honest, vitamin C broke me out so much and I do not use it anymore.

The one rule you need to understand when using vitamin C is to not use any other ingredients in the same routine.

Yes, you heard me correct. Vitamin C improves the efficiency of sunscreen and protects the skin from the free radical damage. It serves no other purpose than this.

Since it is an antioxidant, I find it useful only when using it in the morning specifically. 

### Can you mix VITAMIN C with AHA’s and BHA’s?
Vitamin C is paired best with sunscreen. It increases the effectiveness of the product.

When you pair vitamin C with AHA or BHA, the pH of the acid will be greater than the pH of your skin.

If this happens, I can guarantee redness, irritation, maybe a zit or two and a compromised skin barrier.

Would you want that?

### Can you mix VITAMIN C with NIACINAMIDE?

If we try to simplify and understand each skincare ingredient, it’s often easier for us to determine what might work best for our skin.

<a href="https://www.sheenyskincare.com/what-is-niacinamide/" rel="dofollow" target="blank">Niacinamide is a hyped ingredient</a>. Like vitamin C, niacinamide is also an antioxidant. 

If you want a simple formula of skincare, here it is:

One antioxidant cancels out the other antioxidant. One pigment lighter cancels out the other and so on and so forth.
And the answer to mixing niacinamide and vitamin C is NO. 

There are skin care estheticians who would say yes, and would suggest that if your skin can handle it then go for it. 

However, our skin is not a science lab and we are not testing different products at the same time to see if our skin can handle it or not.

### What can you mix with AHA & BHA?

I know it sounds all fancy but AHAs are (Glycolic, Lactic and Mandelic Acid) and BHA is just Salicylic acid.

AHA helps improve the skin texture by exfoliating the outer layer of the skin. BHA on the other hand penetrates deep and exfoliates the insides.

Similar to retinol, this ingredient also makes your skin sensitive to sunlight and you may want to avoid it during the day. Remeber to put a good sunscreen that protects your skin if you use AHA and BHA in the morning.

### Can you mix AHA and BHA?

Using both the acids together might sound exciting as a lot of work goes in the background however, it can result in dehydrated and irritated skin.

It could also disrupt your skin barrier as this can lead to irritation and even eczema.

Moreover, I personally feel that in skin care, less is always more.

The two things you need to consider when using AHA and BHA is the purpose of using it and the concentration of the product.

If you feel that your skin is dull, and a physical exfoliator is too harsh for you then you can use AHA for replenishing your skin.

If you are trying to treat acne, you can use BHA.

### Can you mix AHA’s and BHA’s WITH NIACINAMIDE?

Acids have a low pH of 3-4, whereas niacinamide has a higher pH at around 5-7. 

If you combine niacinamide with AHA’s and BHA’s, the pH of the niacinamide will increase.

This means that none of the product is going to penetrate inside the skin and do the actual work.

If mixing different skincare ingredient would do too much for your skin, would you still use it? 

The number one mantra of mixing skincare ingredients is identifying what the ingredient is supposed to do. Next, you can identify, whether that ingredient targets your skin concerns.

Well, if the answer is yes, then you can encorporate it in your skincare routine.
