---

I would like to start today's topic with complete honesty and nothing else. It's almost like taking a vow at my wedding. I used to be a freak about my schedule and discipline. But I swear, committing to the intense 10 steps Korean skincare routine indeed is difficult. 

Yet again, it's almost like commitment in love. I never thought I would be using Asian skincare products let alone any skincare products. Especially because I have a different skin tone than all the amazing Asians have, despite being an Asian. 

It indeed is difficult to convince yourself about making a skincare routine. So think about having a daunting 8 step skincare routine. 

You must be thinking about all the expenses you need to make when buying the products and then actually using them when deep inside you know that you're lazy enough to wash your face in the morning after pulling an all-nighter.

Perhaps, now is the time you need to think about changing your approach to Korean skincare routine like you have changed your favorite music genre to k-pop. 

<b>But where do we even start with the trendy Korean morning skincare routine? </b>

Don’t worry, we at sheenycare have you backed up. So if you have impulsively purchased the long list of products and sitting there overwhelmed not knowing what to do, we are here to rescue you. 

First and foremost, let’s start with answering the most asked questions on the web.

## What is the Korean skincare routine all about?
Korean Skincare routines are trendy today. The combination of innovative technology and ancient tradition has made Korean Skincare one of the best beauty routine. Most Korean women use up to 8 to 12 step skincare routine daily to maintain beautiful and healthy skin.

We are already convinced that the Koreans have amazing skin and apparently it seems so that these longs steps are the secret behind Korean beauty.

Korean skincare is famously known as the K beauty routine and it is recommended to anyone who is looking to maximize the benefits of their skincare products.

## How to build a Korean skincare routine?
Now that you've read this far, I'm glad I'm able to make you curious about Korean skincare and anything that follows. 

Well, if you're like me, you know super lazy, thinks that skincare routine is super intensive, I'd like to share a small fact about Korean skincare.

The idea of applying 8 or 10 or even 12 different products is definitely to make your skin glow like the sun.

<b>The good news is you don't actually have to follow a tedious routine every day or at all for that matter.</b>

In other words, you can schedule yourself a #selfcare day and do all the love your skin needs in a single day.


## How to start a Korean Skincare Routine for the Morning?
To get along this topic, let's generalize the idea of any morning skincare routine.

<b>Double Cleanse>Tone>Essence>Moisturize>SPF</b>

Now let's continue the similar process with a few add-ons like some extra bacon on your pizza. In addition, a little bit of detail on Korean skincare routine with products like the cherry on the cake, or maybe a cheesecake?

### Step 1: Double Cleanse
I know that you know about double cleansing but do you? Well if not, what am I for. 

Well as the name suggests, double cleansing in simpler terms means to cleanse twice (no not AM and PM) but rather cleaning your face twice in the same routine.

Let me break this part a little bit:

<b>Double Cleaning = Oil-Based Cleanser + Water-Based Cleanser</b>

Since we're talking about the Korean skincare routine for AM, let me tell you the secrets of Koreans once again.

<b>Koreans usually clean their face with only water and not any cleanser.</b>

Water removes few impurities settled on your skin throughout the night and helps them clear up and aids in hydrating the skin as well.

### Step 2: Apply Toner
Now if you're new to toner (I hope you aren't), toner helps balance the pH level of the skin, which ideally should be slightly acidic – at about 5.5. 

It hydrates the skin along with prepping your skin for further products that you'll be applying.

### Step 3: Apply Essence
The essence is a mixture of toner, serum, and moisturizer. Applying essence is a crucial part of the Korean skincare routine. Essence help in hydrating your skin, increase cellular turnover, and provide a youthful brightness in your skin.

Like the toner, it also prepares the skin for further products you will be applying. Take a small amount on your palm and gently press the essence all over your face rather than sweeping your fingers.

# Step 4: Apply Ampoule
The ampoule is quite similar to serums and essences but is packed with a higher concentration of [active ingredients](https://sheenycare.com/active-ingredients-for-skin-care/){:target="_blank"} that are used to target specific skin concerns. 

Ampoules are used for a specific period of time, especially when your skin needs help. You get ampoules in a dropper like a bottle. Make sure you do not touch the dropper to the skin.

Just a few drops are enough quantity to apply at a time. Use your fingers and press them all over your face gently.

### Step 5: Apply Serum
The serum is packed with several active ingredients together. These serums are packed with a balanced concentration of different active ingredients. They are specifically used for aging, skin dehydration, hyperpigmentation, dark spots, etc.

Hence, use a serum that addresses your skin issues. Take a pea-sized amount and press it gently on the face using your fingertips.

### Step 6: Use an Eye Cream
The area around your eye is the thinnest and super delicate. There is no sebaceous gland to produce natural oil in that area. So you need an eye cream to hydrate and protect this part of the face throughout the day.

Take a little amount of eye cream on your fingertip and apply it from the inner corner of your eye to the outer areas. You can even massage the areas around the eye using an eye cream to soothe the area and help with dark circles if you have any.

### Step 7: Apply Moisturiser
Once you are done with applying eye cream, take a generous amount of moisturizer to apply on the face. The <a href="https://www.sheenycare.com/best-face-moisturizers-all-skin-types/" target="_blank">universal law of applying the moisturizer</a> is to take enough quantity you need for yourselves and warm it first in your palms.

Firstly, take a good amount of the product. Secondly, rub them in between your hands and finally tap the product in the face. Most importantly, do not rub the product on your face, instead, massage gently all over your face and neck.

If you have <a href="https://www.sheenycare.com/what-is-dry-skin/" target="_blank">dry skin</a> then always choose a cream-based moisturizer for yourself, and if you have <a href="https://www.sheenycare.com/skin-care-routine-products-oily-skin/" target="_blank">oily skin</a> use a water-based moisturizer.

### Step 8: Apply Sunscreen
Protecting the skin from UV rays is a must. Sunscreen is a mandatory product.

Finally, applying sunscreen is the last step of your morning skincare routine. Apply and reapply sunscreen as per your skin condition and exposure to the sun.

Always choose a sunscreen with SPF 30 or greater than that. Along with eye cream, sunscreen prevents the eye area, helps with lightening dark spots, and in the long run, even prevents fine lines and wrinkles.

## Does Korean skincare work?
Developing a skincare routine that really works for your skin along with your lifestyle is diligent. And talk about all other factors like your <a href="https://www.sheenycare.com/how-to-determine-my-skin-type/" target="_blank">skin type</a>, age, and stress you take, or even the environment you’re living in.

So it all comes down to experimenting with what really works for you. That being said, Korean skincare products and routines may or may not work for you.

<b>However, the philosophy of Korean Skincare is based on taking care of the skin and identifying the root of the issue you have rather than covering it up with makeup.</b>

These are the 8-step Korean skincare routine order and I have even made your life easier by recommending products based on skin types. Your ideal morning skincare routine should somewhat look like this if you are to follow the morning Korean skincare routine.
