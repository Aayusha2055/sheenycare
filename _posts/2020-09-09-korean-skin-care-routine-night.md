# Step 1: Double Cleanser
## Oil Based Cleanser
Oil based cleanser are used to remove oil based makeup, excess dirt, pollution, sebum and SPF from the skin. It is the first step of the double cleanse method and we use oil at first because of ites repelling property to water. Oil based cleanser are much gentler than the regular makeup wipes and harsh alohols used to wipe off everything from the face.

## Water Based Cleanser
The second step to double cleanse is water based cleanser. It further removes any residue remained of oil based cleansing. When choosing a water based cleanser, choose a gentler formula that doesn;t strip or dry your skin.

# Step 7: Eye Cream
The skin around the eye is thinnest as there are no <a href="https://www.google.com/search?channel=fs&client=ubuntu&q=sebaceous+glands" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"> sebacious gland</a> to produce natural oil. So a simple eye cream is used to hydrate and protect this part of the face.

# Step 8: Exfoliator
This part of the skin care routine comes only 2-3 times a week. Exfoliation helps unclog pores, promotes cell turnover and helps absorption of products into the skin. The famous gommage peels helps in dead skin removals leaving a fresh and youthful skin. Most Koreans use this  mix of botanical and fruit extracts as an exfoliator.

# Step 9: Sheet Masks
Sheets masks are luxury skin care item if I may say, not only because it is aesthetic, but because they are more of an “a la carte” version of necessity. They are formulated with [active ingredients](https://sheenycare.com/active-ingredients-for-skin-care/) as serums. The sheet masks help recover super dry and dehydrates skin in a single use.

# Step 10: Sleeping Masks
Your skin regenerates itself while you're sleeping. Sleeping masks helps boost this process so that yoo get the most out of it. Regular moisturiser does all the job, however using a good quality sleeping masks for 2-3 times a week right before bed prepares you for "the beauty sleep" that you want.
