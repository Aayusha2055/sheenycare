# Skin Care Routine for Men

# Step 1: Cleanse
Every skin care routine starts with cleansing the skin. Cleansing the skin removes dirts and pollution from the skin. You can choose a gentle cleanser based on your skin type and cleanse the skin for about 30 seconds. You need not buy expensive cleansers because you're ultimately washing it off with water.

# Step 2: Exfoliate
Exfoliation helps remove dirt and excess sebum production from the skin. There are generally two ways of exfoliating the skin.

1. **Chemical Exfoliation**: If you have sensitive skin that gets irritated quickly, use a chemical exfoliator. Let the exfoliator stay for few minutes in the skin to do its work and then rinse it off with luke warm water.
Chemical exfoliation penetrates the skin and cleanses it from the inside.

2. **Physical Exfoliation**: Physically exfoliating the skin could be very harsh to your skin. You are likely to breakout and have irritations and redness if your skin cannot tolerate it. It is suggested to use a chemical exfoliator rather than the physical one.

You do not need to exfoliate the skin everyday as overusing <a href="https://www.sheenycare.com/active-ingredients-for-skin-care/" target="_blank">active ingredients</a> will not do any good to your skin.

You should always wear a moisturizer as it helps to hydrate the skin as well as create a protective barrier around the skin.

If you're having a problem choosing the right moisturiser for you then you should first understand your skin type and the weather condition youre living in. Therefore, you're likely to be more dry in the winter than in the summer.
