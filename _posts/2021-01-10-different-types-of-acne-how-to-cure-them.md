Hi people, I’m back again and today we will be talking about the different types of acne and how to treat them.

I am super nervous while I’m writing this because I intend to be the Wikipedia of acne today. Apparently, I never have had problems with or by acne.

Hence, from someone who really doesn’t care about acne to you who is down here because acne has taken over your life, I will help you identify the different types of acne and give insights on how to treat them with some pictures that helps you indentify if you have any.

However, before digging right down the topic, I’d like to ask you something: do you understand what are the different types of acne and what type of acne do you have?

If not, I’d like to start this post with the smallest of details.

## What is acne?
<b>Acne is a skin condition that occurs when your hair follicles become plugged with oil and dead skin cells. Clogged pores cause acne as well. </b>

Acne can be simplified into simpler terms: blemishes, bumps, pimples, breakouts, and many more. The most general name to describe all kinds of acne is "breakout".

Acne usually appears on the face, forehead, chest, upper back, and shoulders.

Either you are a teenager who got their first acne or an adult who is fed up with acne, you need to brace yourself because the game of acne is pretty dirty.

Perhaps the acne you know is only the "pimple" acne but apparently, acne doesn't like to be of only one form. If you're interested to know about the different types of acne then let's head further together.

## What are the main causes of acne?
When the pores in our skin don't let go of oil and dirt, it helps create acne. The other attributes that may cause acne are:
* excess production of oil (sebum)
* bacteria
* hormones
* dead skin cells and
* ingrown hairs

## What are the different types of acne?
Acne has many forms, many types and all the credit goes to clogged pores. The different types of acne are:
* <b>Inflammatory Acne </b> and
* <b>Non-Inflammatory Acne </b>

My first ever acne was right before I got my first period. And ever since that I almost am concerned about hormonal acne and nothing else. So you know now that acne is usually associated with hormonal fluctuations.

Likewise, you too must have had your first acne during your teenage years. The easiest method to treat acne by far is by identifying which type of acne you're experiencing.

<b>It is possible to have multiples types of acne at once i.e you can experience both inflammatory and non-inflammatory acne at once.</b>

The subtypes of acne are:
* blackheads
* whiteheads
* papules
* pustules
* nodules
* cysts

These are the most common signs and symptoms of acne. You may have an ignorable to severe condition of any of the different types of acne mentioned above. 

Therefore, before it is too late, you must identify what kind of acne you have and if you need help from a dermatologist or not.

## How do I know what type of acne do I have?

You have to identify whether you have a blackhead, pustule, or something else for yourself. In some cases, people are mistaken for several other issues that appear like acne.

<b>Acne can form several types of skin blemish, each with a distinct appearance and symptoms.</b>

Let's find out what different types of acne blemishes looks like and treat them. If you're super concerned about your acne then I do recommend a visit to dermatologists.

### Non-Inflammatory Acne
Honestly, I was super amazed when I found out that even blackheads or whiteheads are acne. Well, this definitely meant that my face was full of mild acne.

But all my acne is non-inflammatory. In simpler terms, not all acne looks like huge bumps like speed breakers on the road. Well, all my pores are clogged and if I happen to pinch anywhere, small white dots pop out.

Clogged pores cause acne. The types of acne that you may experience under non-inflammatory ones are:
* <b>Whiteheads</b>
* <b>Blackheads</b>

The key ingredient that is used to treat non-inflammatory acne is Salicylic Acid. Salicylic acid helps deep cleanse the pores by exfoliating them.

### Blackheads (open comedones)
Blackheads are the result of a combination of dead skin cells and excess sebum production. Well, to identify if you have blackheads or not, refer to the following picture.

In general, the top of the pore stays open whereas the rest of the pore is clogged. Hence, you see a black dot on the surface of your skin.

### Whiteheads (closed comedones)
The other type of non-inflammatory acne is whiteheads. This type of acne is medically known as closed-comedones. 

A whitehead is a type of acne that forms when dead skin cells, oil, and bacteria become trapped within one of your pores.

These are small, whitish, or flesh-colored spots or bumps. The entire pore is clogged (closed) starting from the head of the pore.

Neither blackhead nor whitehead pimple can be removed or fixed by squeezing them. Therefore it is important you realize that picking them up will only lead to scarring.

### How to treat blackheads and whiteheads?
There are several ways to treat different types of acne. Often, active ingredients are used to treat non-inflammatory acne. 

Moisturizers, gels, toners, and creams with a mix of active ingredients are the different types of acne medication that can treat non-inflammatory acne.

There are a few over-the-counter(OTC) whitehead and blackhead treatments that include:

* sulfur (may take up to 3 months before you begin to see results)
* salicylic acid (takes 2-12 weeks to treat acne)
* benzoyl peroxide (starts from 4 weeks of application and takes up to 2-4 months for the treatment to have a full effect)
* resorcinol (available only with your doctors prescription)

Moreover, when choosing one of these OTC to treat whiteheads and blackheads to stop such pimples coming on the face, you need to understand that these treatments require patience and consistency.

### Inflammatory acne
The kinds of pimples that are red and swollen are called inflammatory acne.

Remember when I said all I cared about is my hormonal acne because yes, they get super big, red, is painful when touched, and also leava a slight mark of its visit?

Apparently, sebum and dead skin cells contribute to inflammatory acne. In addition, bacteria also plays a vital role in clogging the pores.

The sole reason why your pimple may hurt is that these stupid bacterias cause an infection deep beneath your skin’s surface.

As a result, inflammatory acne blemishes includes:

* papules
* pustules
* nodules
* cysts

### Minor to Mild Acne
#### Papules
Papules are comedones that become inflamed and form small red bumps on the skin.

They occur when the walls surrounding your pores break down from severe inflammation.

Unlike whiteheads, papules have no visible center. Unlike blackheads, the pores of a papule do not appear to be widened.

Papules develop when whiteheads or blackheads cause so much irritation that they damage some of the surrounding skin.

Therefore, the damage leads to inflammation and the skin around these pores is usually pink.

#### Pustules
Pustules are larger, tender bumps with a defined circular center. The center is filled with whitish or yellowish pus, and the bump has a pink or red base. 

Immune cells and bacterial cells collect to form this pus. They resemble whiteheads.

Similarly, pustules can also form when the walls around your pores break down. They typically look like much larger and more inflamed whiteheads.

### How to treat pustules and papules?
Minor to mild papules and pustules can be treated with several home remedies as well as over the counter medicines.

In other workds, you have to:

* wash the affected area twice a day using cool water and clean hands.
* you may also apply gentle facecloth twice a day.
* apply a warm compress to the affected area for 10-15 minutes to allow the trapped debris to rise to the surface.
* use products with benzoyl peroxide
* use products with salicylic acid to remove dead skin cells

#### Nodules
Nodules are large, inflamed bumps that feel firm to the touch. They develop deep within the skin and are often painful. Nodules should be treated by a dermatologist since they can scar. 

Over-the-counter treatments may not be powerful enough to clear them up, but prescription drugs can be effective.

The sooner you start treatment, the fewer permanent scars you’ll have.

#### Cysts
Cysts are very large, soft, painful, red or white lumps situated deep in the skin. They are filled with pus.

People who develop nodules and cysts are usually considered to have a more severe form of acne. 

Like nodules, cysts can be painful and should be treated by a dermatologist since they also can scar.

Moderate to severe nodules and cysts cannot be treated at home and these require care from a doctor or dermatologists.

In adition, doctors may use many products and procedures to treat nodules and cysts.

* oral contraceptives for hormonal-related acne
