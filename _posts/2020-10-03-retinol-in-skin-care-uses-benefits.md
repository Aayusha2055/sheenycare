Retinol in skin care is considered equivalent to the gold standard of skin care products. It was one of those ingredients that I incorporated into my skincare routine as soon as I completed my research on it.


The fact that it is considered equivalent to the gold standard in skincare products tells a lot about the volume of it and the advantages it has over the skin.


Above all, retinol is one of the most studied skin care ingredients and today we can find several products with retinol in them such as retinol creams and retinol serums.


It is a key ingredient that is used today to improve the skin. To be precise, retinol deals with fine lines, wrinkles, pore size, uneven skin tone, and texture. In addition, it is also proven to treat acne. It indeed is an ingredient with superpowers.


That is why I started using retinol in skin care routine. If you're also willing to do so, I would totally recommend it but make sure you understand your skin before that and the ingredient itself aswell.


# What is Retinol?
Retinol is a form of vitamin A (one form ), a fat-soluble derivative. It is mostly found in animal foods such as whole milk, oily fish, and liver. It promotes skin cell turnover and helps your body form and maintain healthy skin.



Technically, it is a type of retinoid of which there are several variations:
1.**Retinoic acid** - It is <ahref="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/bioavailable"rel="nofollow"target="_blank">bioavailable</a> and works faster than other variations.
2.**Retinol/Retinaldehyde/Esters** - These need to be converted by your skin into retinoic acid and hence works slower than other variations.



As mentioned above, there are several types of retinol with a variety of percentages and ingredient subtypes. There is a weird kind of myth about retinol which says **All retinol is the same**.



In fact, retinol is a huge family of the compound derivative of vitamin A. It goes from **Over the Counter (OTC)** to prescription strength in topical and oral medication form.

OTC Retinols are mostly found in serums, eye creams, and night moisturizers.



Now that we've categorized several kinds of retinol, these all serve a purpose bringing down a question, **Why should you use retinol?**. Let's find out the answer to the most searched query on the web.



# What does Retinol do for your skin?
You can expect big from Retinol solely because it is a gold-standard ingredient in skincare.


It is known to increase the collagen in the skin which alters the behavior of aged cells i.e **with an increase in collagen in the skin cell, fine lines, and wrinkles are reduced making the skin thicker**.



Topical vitamin-A is the most studied anti-aging ingredient. Tretinoin was the first retinoid. In the late 1970's it was used to treat acne. Researchers later discovered that it also **fades actinic keratosis spots, evens pigmentation, and speeds the turnover of superficial skin cells**.



Above all, retinols **stimulate the production of new blood vessels in the skin**, and**improves the color of the skin**. It also helps **fade age spots and softens rough patches of the skin** and**regulates oily skin and minimizes breakouts**.



As a result, you look younger and your skin looks healthy when you consistenly use this ingredient.




# Who needs Retinol?
**Aging skin, hyperpigmented skin, acne, dark spots, clogged pores, uneven skin tone** and much more skin conditions might need Retinol.



# Is Retinol safe for all skin types?
Retinol is safe for all skin types but it may cause dryness, redness, and irritation to some especially if it's the first time using it. Therefore, if you want to use retinol in skin care routine, you should start slow.



# When to start using Retinol?
Since retinol was used to specifically treat acne in the late 1970s, so it was prescribed to young people back then as well. **"Young people cannot use retinol" is a complete myth**.


However, because this is a complex ingredient and further researches was done at the latter time, it completely depends on the skin condition rather than any age restriction.


There is nonetheless, a proper way to prepare your skin if you want to start using retinol in skin care routines. In other words, if you have had a basic skincare routine of daily sunscreen and moisturizer in your teens then you can start using Retinol in your **mid 20s**.


Furthermore, it is completely safe for men and women to use retinol in their **early 20's** to help boost collagen and reduce the signs of premature aging.



A general opinion by a dermatologist would insist you to incorporate a product with retinol in skin care routine at **age 30** for three to four times a week. By 40's you should use it every other night whereas people beyond 50s and 60s may incorporate it for 5 to 7 times per week.



# How to apply Retinol for the best results?
Now that we've known that Retinol is a highly beneficial [active ingredient](https://sheenycare.com/active-ingredients-for-skin-care/){:target="_blank"}, it does depend on how we use it to achieve optimal benefits from it.



You should always start with products that contain low concentration (0.025) of the ingredient first and see how your skin reacts to it before moving to a higher concentration.



Here's how you can incorporate retinol in skin care routine.



### Step 1
Wash your face and wait for it to be completely dry.



### Step 2
After that, apply eye cream first as areas around the eye are delicate.



### Step 3.
In addition, dry your face completely because slightly dampen skin might irritate the skin as it is able to absorb the product completely.


### Step 4.
Once dried, you can take a pea-sized amount of the product and start at your chin, gradually to the upwards and outward motion.



### Step 5.
Finish with your moisturizer and always look for moisturizers with <ahref="https://www.sheenycare.com/hyaluronic-acid-skin-benefits-uses"target="_blank">Hyaluronic Acid:</a> and <ahref="https://www.sheenycare.com/what-is-ceramide/"target="_blank">Ceramides</a>. You can also choose the buffering technique, where you apply moisturizer before applying retinol to reduce its side effects.



### Step 6.
Always remember to use broad-spectrum sunscreen the morning after as retinol makes the skin more sensitive to the sun.


Furthermore, using vitamin C in the AM in accordance with using retinol in the PM, as they work synergetically, will help your skin look its best.



# How long does it take to work?
Research shows that Retinol in skin care starts working within **4-12 weeks** of application to treat **acne**, **12-24 weeks** for fine lines and wrinkles whereas **24 weeks** to treat **hyperpigmentation**.



# Side effects of using Retinol.
Retinol is an extremely powerful skincare ingredient. Overuse of this ingredient might cause several skin issues.


You can also experience some when you first start to apply it. Here are some that you must know about if you are going to use retinol in skin care routine.



1. If you use it too often, your skin can redden and start peeling. But this doesn't mean it thins the skin.
2. You can also experience flakiness, dryness, and some breakouts when you first use retinol in skin care regimen.
3. If your **pregnant**, or considering pregnancy, you should consult your obstetrician before beginning or continuing your retinol treatment.
