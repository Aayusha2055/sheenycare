I was recently getting so many questions from my fellow followers and friends about ceramide, products with ceramide, and some famous ceramide capsules.

I felt as if ceramide suddenly was a very big deal. Yes, I mean it is, but still, since everyone was asking about it, I thought of doing a proper blog about it.

First and foremost, here’s a blog that I’ve already written about ceramide.

<a href="https://www.sheenycare.com/what-is-ceramide/" rel="dofollow" target="_blank">Everything you need to know about Ceramides is here.</a>

Regardless, I’ll still give a heads up on the subject matter.

Ceramide is like blood, or organs we already have in our body. Except it is a form of liquid present in our skin. It’s as natural as hairs on our skin.

Well, with ceramide the skin is able to maintain moisture preventing any kind of dryness, itching, or irritation.

You might as well think that “Oh! is it just for dry skin?”, and my answer is NO. Why would anything be only made for dry skin, when it is natural and found in every skin.

Moreover, you can increase the amount of ceramide in your body by eating good foods high in ceramides such as Soybeans, dairy, eggs, sweet potatoes, wheat germ, corn, and brown rice.

Now, let’s get straight to the topic. Here are the list if the best skin barrier repair products packed with ceramide.

## Top 10 Products With Ceramide
