# What exactly are 'actives'?
Long answer short, if you have acne, your'e looking for products that deals with acne, if you have hyperpigmentation, you're looking for products that deals with it. Hence, 'actives' are those ingredients in a product that deals with a specific skin condition or whatever skin concern it is meant to target.

If you're new to the skin care world, you probably would want to know what actives are and why you should be adding them to your skin care regimen.

# As said above, an active are those ingredients that contains an active ingredient in them.

Let's talk parallely about the ingredients and skin concerns we must be using them for:

## Alpha Hydroxy Acids (AHA): Exfoliate
AHA a class of chemical exfoliants are a good news to even sensitive skin as they are super safe to use. Common AHA's such as <u>Glycolic Acid</u>, <u>Lactic Acid</u> and <u>Mandelic Acid</u> are used abundantly these days in all kinds of products such as cleansers, toners, masks and creams to loosen dead skin cells and smooth the skin. Unlike using physical exfoliators directly to your face, chemical exfoliators are much gentler, as you do not need to scrub them harshly in your skin.

## Beta Hydroxy Acids (BHA): Clear Breakouts
BHA's specifically are acne treating ingredients. Commonly used Salicylic Acid is a part of beta hydroxy acid and today is a part of every skin care product that deals with acne and breakouts. <u>Salicylic Acid</u> is known to remove dead skin cells by getting deep into your pores and cleaning it. Because salicylic acid is a non comodogenic ingredient, it is more likely to loosen blackheads and clear pores. Also, it is not irritating to your skin as compared to benzoyl peroxide.

## Vitamin C: Brigten Skin
Vitamin C is commonly found in various fruits and also sold as dietary supplements. Vitamin C is an essential nutrient involved in the repair of tissue and the enzymatic production of certain neurotransmitters. It is also known as ascorbic acid and has a huge role in collagen synthesis.

Vitamic C is a vital molecule for skin health. The antioxidant properties of vitamin C has been proved to improve the efficiency of sunscreen if layered underneath it to help prevent and treat ultraviolet (UV)-induced photodamage.

## Retinol: Firm and Smooth Skin
Retinol is a vitamin A derivative with multiple skin benefits such as skin cell turnover, unclogging pores, smooth skin, refine skin textures and lighten age spots. It is a must use ingredient in skin care regimen after 20 as it is also known for its ability to treat fine lines, wrinkles as well as acne. Hence, Retinol could be "the anti-aging" ingredient that has ever been discovered till date. This ingredient could be drying to some skin types and on that note, you have to consult to your dermatologist. 

Do not be confused with Retin A and Tretinoin as Retinol is a derivative of Vitamin A whereas Retin-A and Tretinoin are vitamin A.

## Hyaluronic Acid: Hydrate
Hyaluronic Acid has an amazing molecular property of holding up to 1,000 times its weight in water. Hyaluronic acid, also called as hyaluron is a clear, silky smooth substance that is naturally produced by the body. It is able to improve the texture of the skin as well as its apperance.
Our body naturally decreases the production of Hyaluronic acid in our body after 30, which is why it is also a powerful anti-aging skin care ingredient.

## Niacinamide: Reudce Inflamation
Niacinamide is a form of Vitamin B-3. It has anti-inflammatory properties and antioxidant properties. A lot of dermatologists ask you to apply topical niacinamide-based products to treat hyperpigmentation, acne and rosacea.  

## Ceramids: Improve Barrier Function
Ceramides are lipids that help form the skin's barrier and help skin retain moisture. A healthy skin barrier is a must for obtaining helathy skin and ceramides help you fortify it. Ceramides are also naturally produced by the body. And if theres enough of it, your skin will automatically fight to keep pollutions and dirts out. What cermaide does is make a "water-proof barrier" in the upper layer of the skin. They help in regulating cells and repairing skin's natural barrier.

Cermaide production decreases with age. Hence, make sure to use ceramide-based moisturiser. By doing so, you will help your skin form ceramides on its own.

## Peptides: Boosts Collagen
A peptide is a short chain of amino acids. They basically communicate between skin cells. They occur naturally and help regulate hormonal activity, activate or deactivate immune responses, and stimulate wound healing. Regular application of peptides will boost your collagen production, stop collagen degradation and relax the wrinkles ultimately making your skin look younger.

## Vitamin E: Protect
Vitamin E are typically used in skin care ingredients especially in collaboration with Vitamin C to stabilize the unsbale formulation of Vitamin C. Vitamin E are also naturally found in human skin, but are depriciated due to the constant exposure of skin in the sun and other nevironmantal factors. Adding Vitamin E in your skin care regimen will be give an extra protection to your skin. 

## Curcuminoids: Glow
If you've ever heard of using turmeric to improve your skin, it is because turmeric consists of Curcuminoids in its powerhouse. It has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. It is able to give you the glow you want when regularly incorporated in your diet. The skin brightening properties of turmeric can be achieved by looking for capsules that pair curcuminoids with more easily digested lipids for better absorption.
