We have all seen and heard how dermatologists recommend CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser for people with acne. It works to cleanse the skin and remove oil, without disrupting the skin’s protective barrier.

Also, it won’t clog pores or dry the skin out. The product contains niacin-amide (helps in dealing inflammation) and ceramides to help calm and moisturize irritated skin.
