# Why is it the talk of the town?
The most common skin issues people have to face are acne,rosacea, pigmentation, fine lines and wrinkles. There are many <a href="https://www.sheenycare.com/active-ingredients-for-skin-care/" rel="dofollow" target="_blank">active ingredients</a> that target such skin issues. However, Niacinamide is claimed to be the **"active ingredient"** that targets all the skin issues at once and treat them. 

Most of the studies about it have been carried out at concentrations of 5% or below. And yes, it can do everything it's purported to: improve hyperpigmentation, fortify barrier function, normalize sebum production etc. However, we need to realize that niacinamide, and a whole host of other "actives" can do more harm than good when overused.
