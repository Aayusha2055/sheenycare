# An insight To <a href="https://www.sheenycare.com/dry-skin-causes-and-treatment/" target="_blank">Dry Skin</a>
Medically known as Xerosis, dry skin is not usually serious and is caused by the temperature and humidity level around you. If you have dry skin, you might notice small fine flakes, cracking and dry patches in your skin. You should protect your skin in the morning and hydrate it in the evening that is why, you need to have a proper skin care routine for dry skin Hence, the skin condition could get worst if you do not add a skin care routine for your dry skin.

# Skin care routine for Dry Skin

# Hydrating Cleanser:
Use a very gentle but hydrating cleanser for about a minute to cleanse your skin.
Something as gentle as the <u>Himalaya moisturizing aloe vera face wash</u> is a blessing to your skin. And if you would want to steep a little high, opt for a <u>cetaphil gentle skin cleanser</u>. Just make sure the product you’re using doesn’t let your skin feel tight and stripping after the wash.


<u>CeraVe's Hydrating Facial Cleanser</u>, which includes ceramides and hyaluronic acid, has been internationally renowned today and seems to be the favorite cleanser for all. And for those who suffer from the redness, consider products with niacinamide as it aids with inflammation. A lot of people use these products in their skin care routine today.


> **Cleansing Tip for extremely dry skin:**
Skip using a cleanser and just wash your face with normal water(not too cold, not too hot) to wash your face in the morning. Avoid foaming cleansers.



# Hydrating Toner:
Go easy with toners if you have sensitive skin. because most toners are full of alcohol and unwanted chemicals that are likely to harm your skin. I personally recommend using a gentle toner in your skin that is packed with good hydrating ingredients such as Hyaluronic Acid that would lock up all the moisture in your skin. If serums seem to exceed your budget, opt for a toner with hyaluronic acid.
<u>Neutrogena's Alcohol-Free Hydrating Toner</u> can be your best pick.


> **Toning Tip for dry skin:**
Skip this step if the ingredient list on the toner you're using seems to do nothing at all. Also, stop spending your money on Mario Badescu.


# Serum:
Serums are packed with concentrated ingredients. You have to choose an antioxidant protection serum such as Vitamin C in your skin care regimen, especially in the morning, . Vitamin C does wonders for your skin. Vitamin C serum from <u>DermaFix</u> aids your skin beautifully despite a slight fragrance in it. But the ingredient list completely satisfies why it does have fragrance.


And for the night, a serum with retinol is a good option. "Retinols can also be applied in serum-form; bakuchiol, a naturally derived retinol is often more tolerable for dry skin." Start with minimum concentrate retinol. You can start with <u>Tretin-A, 0.025%,</u> which is easily available in your nearest drugstore.


> **Serum Tip for dry skin:**
Invest in Hyaluronic Acid Serum as retinol is a drying ingredient that has plenty of benefits to your skin. Since you can't avoid retinol, you have to have good hydrating serums with you.


# Moisturizer:
You need a good moisturizer to hydrate the skin, regardless of the skin type. A good moisturizer for dry skin should have ceramides that do wonders for the skin. Something as gentle as the CeraVe moisturizer works best for the skin. <u>CeraVe, Cetaphil, lubriderm</u> are few of the best dermatologists approved moisturizers for your dry skin.


> **Moisturizer Tip for dry skin:**
Never buy products with parabens and denatured alcohol, ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, or benzyl alcohol. These are meant to penetrate your skin deeper but ultimately result in breakouts and drier skin.


# Eye Cream:
Since the under-eye area is more sensitive than others, it's a lot drier, too. To protect the delicate area, be sure to use a rich eye cream every night before bed. If you're using a good moisturizer and are short of budget, you may skip this step because eye creams are quite expensive.
<u>Himalaya Under Eye Cream</u> however can fit right in your budget. However, <u>CeraVe's</u> under eye cream can be your best pick.


# Sunscreen:
No matter what, do not skip this step in the AM. You have to wear your sunscreen no matter if you're staying indoors or even wearing makeup. No matter the season, you need to keep your skin safe from the environment. Consider a serum-like formula that won't give you a streaky white finish.
When buying one, always buy SPF 50++.


<u>Neutrogena's</u> suncreen and <u>La Roche Posay's</u> spf 50++ are the best pick sunscreen for dry skin. Also, <u>CeraVe</u> can never be out of this list.
