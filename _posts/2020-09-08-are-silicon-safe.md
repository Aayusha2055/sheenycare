The paraben free fuss is really huge. But so is using skin care products with silicone. Silicone is made from silicon (sand), oxygen and other elements. They have been used in skin care products for years.

# What is Silicone?
Silicone are made of completely natural ingredients but undergo chemical processing. They are used to improve the texture of skin care products. They are beneficial for the skin because of its emolliency (skin smoothing) and water loss prevention properties.

# Controversies on Silicone!
The term <u>"synthetic"</u> is used to undermine the properties of silicone. They are said to be <u>"unnatural"</u>.

They are claimed <u>bad for sensitive skin</u>.

They are also said to be <u>toxic for the body and the environment</u>.

Silicons are said to be <u>comodogenic</u>, causing acne and clogged pores.

# Facts About Silicone!
Research upto date hasn't showed adverse effect of silicone on humans. Definitive evidence of harm is lacking. Silicone is <u>hypoallergenic</u> i.e. it is relatively unlikely to cause an allergic reaction.

Once and for all, for people at the back, it is **<u>non-comodogenic</u>** (DOESN'T clog pores).

Silicones are <u>not known to sensitize skin</u>. 

It is <u>porous</u> (having minute interstices through which liquid or air may pass) and rather helps <u>increase penetration of other active ingredients</u>.

Silicones are volatile, i.e, it evaporates quickly and does not penetrate pores.

> So next time, someone tells you silicones are bad for your skin, do not explain them why they are super good and rather slam this blog to them.
