I used to really exfoliate with physical exfoliators...tsk tsk, I know right, I didn’t have the access to the right information like you guys do now *wink*. 

After some research, I found out about our elixir, Salicylic Acid! Fantastically, infused in  CeraVe Renewing Salicylic Acid Cleanser. As a result, I haven’t been turning back ever since. 

Salicylic Acid also improves dryness and softens the rough skin, we should really appreciate it *salutes*!

The product we really vouch for is by CeraVe, CeraVe Renewing Salicylic Acid Cleanser infused with salicylic acid enhances the barrier-strengthening with the ingredients like ceramides.
