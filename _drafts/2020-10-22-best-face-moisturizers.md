Finding the perfect moisturizer for your skin is not that difficult. Now that we know, how to <a href="http://www.sheenycare.com/how-to-determine-my-skin-type/" target="_blank">determine our skin type</a>, finding the right product for us gets super easy. Today we will be talking about dermatologically approved best face moisturizers for all skin types.

But before heading directly onto the subject matter, let's understand what a moisturizer is and why is it so important in a skin care routine.

# What is a moisturizer?
A moisturizer is an <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/emulsion-chemistry" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">emulsion</a> of oil, water, and other nourishing ingredients that keeps the skin moisturized, replenishes hydration, and prevents drying of the skin.

Our body naturally produces a moisturizing entity called sebum. Moisturizer on the other hand is the cosmetic preparation for doing the same function the sebum does. For a healthy skin, both sebum and moisturizer are required.

# Why do we need a moisturizer?
Our body retains a heavy amount of water. A huge amount of water is also retained by the skin as the skin is the largest organ of our body. But, water constantly evaporates from the deeper level of the skin. This effect is also called transepidermal water loss.

Water in the skin helps prevent the skin from drying or becoming rigid. Hence, the skin has to be able to retain the moisture. A barrier named the lipid barrier (also called moisture barrier) protects the skin from drying and prevents water loss from the skin.

Lipid barrier is found in the stratum corneum (outer layer of the skin) and consists of dead skin cells and natural fats. When we slowly start to age, the lipid barrier is not able to retain and provide proper moisture to the skin. This is why we need a moisturizer.

# Who needs a moisturizer?
Our skin naturally produces oil, enough to moisturize the skin. But we also wash and shower more often. When we over clean our face and body, we actually remove the oils naturally produced in the skin. Therefore, the skin tends to be drier. when the skin's ability to do what it normally does is hampered.

But this does not mean we should not be cleaning ourselves regularly. Hygiene comes first. But yes, we need a moisturizer. We just need to make sure that we are not over-applying it.

If we do so, the skin will become dry, sensitive, and will interfere with natural hydration.

# Different types of moisturizers.
Basically it all comes down to skin having proper hydration, which is only possible if you have enough water in the skin. In short, the “real” moisturizer is water. Moisturizing lotions are just other chemicals mixed with water which keeps the water a little long in the skin.

There are three basic types of moisturizers today.

## 1. Humectant:
Humectant acts like a sponge-like moisturizer that retains water. It works best when layered before an occlusive to prevent loss of water from the lower layers of the skin.

Such moisturizers are best for oily, combination, and dehydrated skin types.

Examples of Humectants are:
* Glycerin
* Hyaluronic Acid
* AHAs
* Urea

## 2. Emollient:
Emollients smooth the epidermis by filling in the gaps between the skin cells/flakes with lipids and oils.

It is best for dry skin.

Examples of Emollients are:
* Ceramides
* Cholesterol
* Squalene
* Plant Oils

They are available as lotions, creams, ointments, bath oils or soap substitutes.
 
## 3. Occlusive:
Occlusives coat the skin in a protective film, sealing the water from the skin. It works best when layered after a humectant to prevent loss of water from the layers of the skin.

It is best for dry skin, eczema, and psoriasis.

Examples of Occlusives are:
* Petroleum Jelly
* Mineral Oils
* Dimethicone
* Beeswax

Occlusives are insensitive to oxidation. This is why they have replaced vegetable oils in topical medications.

# Benefits of using a moisturizer.
You can expect the following benefits from moisturizers:

## 1. Aging:
Moisturizing can prevent tearing or brushing of the skin. A moisturizer works to improve the appearance of a wrinkle. Wrinkles are also a result of the lack of hydration in the skin. BY using hydrating moisturizers, you can prevent the aging of the skin.

## 2. Prevents Dullness:
The skin on our face, especially the face, ears, neck, and chest are very sensitive to environmental changes. They have frequently exposed parts of our bodies. These areas of skin also shed cells more rapidly than other parts of the body. Hence, they need proper moisture to repair itself which allows for younger skin cells to rise to the surface.

## 3. Strengthens Preventive Barrier:
Daily moisturizing the skin can reduce the chance of developing extreme dryness or oiliness. Both extremes are harmful to the skin and cause common skin conditions like acne.

## 4. Primes the Skin:
Using moisturize which is suitable for your skin will boost hydration in the skin, prevents flaking and dullness, and creates a protective layer of moisture that lasts all day. Hence, it primes the skin for any further damage and exposure to harmful rays and pollutions of the environment.

# Few myths on moisturizer.
There are few bizzare myths about moisturizer you must know in order to clear your heads on how to use them properly in your skin care routine. Let's check them out one by one.

## Myth 1: Moisturizer should be applied on dry skin.
Moisturizers should actually be applied on damp skin rather than dry skin because, the main motive of applying moisturizer is to lock hydration and prevent excess water from evaporating from the skin. That is why moisturizer is normally used after toner and serum in order to help it spread more evenly and be absorbed by the skin into deeper level.

## Myth 2: More moisturizer means more hydration.
Good quality moisturizers generally contains all the necessary ingredients required to heal, prevent and hydrate your skin. Even a small amount goes a long way. If your'e using too much moisturizer then chances are you are either using wrong products or over moisturizing your skin. Using too much product will sit on the top layer of the skin and might clog your pores as well. Hence, use only the required quantity necesasry to moisturize your skin for the day and night as well.

## Myth 3: You dont need sunscreen if moisturizer has SPF.
This is one of the biggest misconception people have. You really need a good UVA protected sunscreen of SPF 30 and above. It might be okay during the winter but you need a proper protection during the summer. Infact, moisturizer with SPF and moisturizer and SPF are two differnet skin care products and should be used independently as they have their own uses and benefits over the skin.

There are few of the myths that people have over moisturizers. So, if you have had believed any of it, then it's high time to educate yourself about it.
