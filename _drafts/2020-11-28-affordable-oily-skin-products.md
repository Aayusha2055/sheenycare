There is a soft corner in my heart for people with oily skin. Not because such skin type is the hardest to take care of but rather because they need to be extremely careful about what goes in their skin.

My bestfriend has oily skin as well. She suffers from breakouts to blotchiness, redness to flareups and what not. Since I have been recommending some products to her, which has slowly changed her skin, I thought why not share it with my readers as well. And perhaps like my friend you all might as well have a misconception. The biggest one being, you need to spend a fortune in order to take care of your skin. But this is also a hoax like the others.

The ultimate goal of any skincare rookie is to achieve healthy and glowing skin. However, this might as well question the expenses you have made so far on worthless products that failed your skin. Yes, skincare products are affordable and despite what everyone else say, they are cheap. You can build a perfect and affordable skincare routine though there is no harm in spending a huge amount of money as well.

Now, if you are interested in finding if your <a href="https://www.sheenycare.com/how-to-determine-my-skin-type/" target="_blank">skin is oily</a> or not, then you have landed in the right place. You can also read about building the <a href="https://www.sheenycare.com/skin-care-routine-products-oily-skin/" target="_blank">best skin care routine</a> for your oily skin and enhance your knowledge on this scope. Now let’s get on with products that generally work for oily skin.

## Best skincare products for oily skin.

### 1. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00U1YCRD8/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=sheenycare-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=3767264f4116427ef2dc4cd6caa8dd1a&creativeASIN=B00U1YCRD8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CeraVe Salicylic Acid Cleanser ($13.99)</a>
The extra sebum production generally cause breakouts. Breakouts or not, using salicylic acid cleanser to cleanse the face never goes wrong. It actually works great and you can use any active ingredient later on (even those which you should not be using with salicylic acid) because you are anyways washing it off. This frangnace-free cleanser contains ceramides, niacinamide and a whole bunch off good ingredients. But like any other product, you should first try and see if it works for you or not. It worked great for my friend and she too has started recommending this product to everyone.

Likewise, aveeno's amazing foaming cleanser is a non comodogenic cleanser with salycilic acid. It is perfect to treat breakouts and prevent new ones. This cleanser also contains soy, which is known to even out the skin tone.

### 3. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B010RAX1L2/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=sheenycare-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=1d52272cbc0d5bb9beb50fcf9456022d&creativeASIN=B010RAX1L2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Simple Micellar Cleansing Water ($5.74)</a>
My friend often gets acne (oily skin problems). And she also does the same mistake like most of us does: not properly removing dirts and makeup from our skin. She argues with me and complains all the time that her cleanser doesn't work properly and I am almost tired of telling her that just cleansing once is not enough.

Hence, a gentle amount of micellar water as a first step to cleanse before bed will help prevent acne. Once you start using it, you'll swear by this product. Thoroghly remove makeup or any dirt your skin might have catched throughout the day and follow by your favourite cleanser to remove any remaining residue on the face.

### 4. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BSV1T35/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=sheenycare-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=ba53b295b793f08672bb8aa804fef511&creativeASIN=B07BSV1T35" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Banila Clean It Zero ($17.54)</a>

Now that I have already mentioned about double cleansing, oil cleanser can be used instead of micellar water. This double cleansing technique was the hardest to convince my friend about. She was like "I hate oils on my face, let alone oil cleanser". But what's the big deal when all your doing is cleansing and then washing it off.

I personally love oil cleanser as oil dissolves any product we use on our skin, resulting a clear skin after washing off. Furthermore, Banila's clean it zero is my favourite. It's main ingredient are emulsifying alcohol and palm oil, and it doesn’t leave residue on the skin.

This one is not actually fragnance free and if you're sensitive to fragnances, handle this product with care.

### 5. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IDWP4IA/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=sheenycare-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=11431687f883e563a60b468eaa82e757&creativeASIN=B00IDWP4IA" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">InstaNatural Vitamin C Serum ($16.75)</a>

The first reason I recommend this product is because I love Hyaluronic acid in my Vitamin C. Infact both of these ingredient are a must in anyone's skin care routine and well when you get them both together you should click the buy now button.

The only problem acne-oily prone skin people may find with Vitamin C is that it could be slightly acidic but then Hyaluronic Acid is the perfect solution to this problem. Hyaluronic acid acts as an humectant and not as a moisturizer. Well these are two different <a href="https://www.sheenycare.com/best-face-moisturizers-all-skin-types/" target="_blank">types of moisturizers</a> that are found in skin care products. 

<!-- <iframe style="width:120px;height:240px;" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&OneJS=1&Operation=GetAdHtml&MarketPlace=US&source=ac&ref=tf_til&ad_type=product_link&tracking_id=sheenycare-20&marketplace=amazon&region=US&placement=B00IDWP4IA&asins=B00IDWP4IA&linkId=11431687f883e563a60b468eaa82e757&show_border=false&link_opens_in_new_window=false&price_color=333333&title_color=00c5a1&bg_color=ffffff"></iframe> -->

### 6. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GDT961B/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=sheenycare-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=b541214afb9f82b9cb0e6827531f0c5f&creativeASIN=B07GDT961B" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cetaphil Pro Oil Absorbing Moisturizer SPF 30 ($14.36)</a>
So we were actually doing an amazon haul which brought us to this product. This product is non-comodogenic and has a matte finish unlike other moisturizers with SPF 30, which is perfect ratio. My friend immediately bought it and ever since that, she has not changed her moisturizer.

### 7. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N9SPQHQ/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=sheenycare-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=5191eb7e2676d7ad7d56198e652ce591&creativeASIN=B01N9SPQHQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">La Roche Posay Toleriane Ultra Cream ($14.99)</a>

I recently came across this product when my friend for Australia sent me a packaging. I asked my best friend to use this oil free moisturizer just so I could review about it and she didn't return this product back. Infact, she keeps ordering it and is one of her favourite night moisturizers.

This face moisturizer provides up to 48-hour hydration  and helps restore skin's barrier. It is also non comodogenic i.e it won't clog pores.

It is formulated with a high concentration of Prebiotic Thermal Water, Ceramide-3, Niacinamide & Glycerin.

### 8. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00J5N0Y4U/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=sheenycare-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=1ead0c5c470aba5ac5a25242941ec406&creativeASIN=B00J5N0Y4U" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">InstaNatural Niacinamide 5% Face Serum ($15.99)</a>
Niacinamide is a holy grail ingredient for people with oily skin. I have already mentioned products that includes niacinamide as their key ingredients. Like vitamin C, niacinamide is also an antioxidant and you might use this on night whereas vitamin C on day time. This ingredient has anti-aging properties and it’s anti-inflammatory, so it will calm redness in your skin. It also plays well with lots of other ingredients, so you don’t have to worry about how it mixes.

This mineral-based sunscreen, also known as a physical sunscreen, reflects UVA/UVB rays to protect the skin. It contains three essential ceramides that help restore the skin’s natural barrier and lock in moisture long after application. The product is oxybenzone free, oil free, paraben free, fragrance free, chemical-filter free as well as non-comodogenic.

This sunscreen protects the skin from UVA & UVB rays & antioxidant complex protects it from damaging free radicals.
It also acts as a makeup primer which absorbs quickly & keeps makeup from smudging & fading. It leaves the skin looking refreshed with no greasiness or oily look. The product doesn't leave any white cast and furthermore is fragnance free.

The product is non-comodogenic and well less is more. My mom loves olay, and infact she swears by it. She has been using this product for a very long time and because she trust this one so much, I included this on my list.

<!-- <iframe style="width:120px;height:240px;" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&OneJS=1&Operation=GetAdHtml&MarketPlace=US&source=ac&ref=tf_til&ad_type=product_link&tracking_id=sheenycare-20&marketplace=amazon&region=US&placement=B07GB9GV8M&asins=B07GB9GV8M&linkId=4497f2d7bff3354baf099031c9fbd32f&show_border=false&link_opens_in_new_window=false&price_color=333333&title_color=00c5a1&bg_color=ffffff"></iframe> -->

Well this is all for today. I will be updating as soon as I discover other budget-friendly products for other skin types as well. If you would want to know more dupes of expensive skin care products, I will soon come up with such collections as well.
