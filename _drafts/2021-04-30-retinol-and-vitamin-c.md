As a skincare enthusiast myself, I’ve been cleaning up my skincare ingredients for a long time now.

Over the last few days, I’ve decided to share them all with you in a single article.

Have you ever used retinol or vitamin C products? If so, what were your initial thoughts on them?

Or, did you just think they were great ingredients to have in everything and that you’re too old to care about their effects?

If so, then this article is for you! In this article, I’ll provide you with an unbiased look at what retinol and vitamin C can do for your skin.

So, feel free to read on and help me out by following me on Pinterest as well; @sheenycare.

For a sample, please follow the guidelines below. Also, follow me to the end of the blog so you do not miss any important information.


![Skincare Ingredients You Should Never Mix](/assets/images/skincare-ingredients-that-dont-go-well-together.png "Skincare Ingredients You Should Never Mix")

Let’s start with the basics.

You may have heard about all of these ingredients working on different areas of your skin but do not understand exactly what they do.

The truth is you can use these powerful, natural products on your entire face (regardless of which side you have the most lines on).

However, applying the wrong products can be detrimental to your skin. The right way to apply them can help your skin look younger, feel flattered, have less stress, and even help fight wrinkles.
## Can You Apply Retinol and Vitamin C at the Same Time?

Vitamin C and retinol (Vitamin A) are natural ingredients that help hydrate and strengthen your skin.

However, if you apply both of these products with care, they can work together to provide you with more lasting results (and less irritation) than either alone.

This is what you may experience if you unwisely use them for your skin:

### Change in the PH Level of Your Face: 
When applying ingredients that are meant to be applied directly to the skin such as retinol or vitamin C, the pH of the skin is usually kept below 4.0 to increase their efficiency.

* <b>Retinol:</b> Retinol typically has a pH between 5.0 and 6.0, as research has shown that's where it operates best. If you have dry, sensitive skin, you're probably not going to want to raise it's concentration too high.

* <b>Vitamin C:</b> The right pH level for vitamin C also means you need to be applying it at the right concentration level. Too much, and you risk irritation. L-Ascorbic Acid, the active form of vitamin C, needs to be at pH 3.5 or lower to effectively penetrate your skin.

Let's get one thing straight: you can’t just apply these two products in the order I tell you. 

If you use them together, the pH gap in between these two ingredients will lower each other's effectiveness.

### Oil and Water Do Not Mix:

I’ve used retinol and vitamin C on and off for just over a year now. My routine has slowly shifted from using them together to using them one at a time. 

* <b>Retinol:</b> This one right here is oil soluble and only dissolves in oil.

* <b>Vitamin C:</b> This however is water-soluble and doesn't dissolve otherwise.

This also must give you a general idea to not mix these ingredients. If you do, they will just create a barrier in the skin but neither of the product will penetrate deep inside.

### How to Apply Retinol and Vitamin C - The Best Ways? 

I tried to use the retinol as a standalone product because I didn’t know if using a lower dosage would help or hurt anything, but as they say, “you can never have too many retinoids” (which I will admit makes me sound like a total skincare nut).

It wasn’t until I started researching more about using retinol and vitamin C together that I saw how beneficial this combination truly is.

### 1. Vitamin C in the Morning, Retinol at Night

Retinol and vitamin C are both incredibly powerful tools in various skin care routines.

If you use vitamin C in the morning and retinol at night, you will avoid creating any new skin problems while potentially increasing the effectiveness of both retinol and vitamin C.

### 2. Vitamin C and Retinol on Alternate Nights

For those of you who don’t know, retinol is a blockbuster ingredient found in high concentration in some products to use on a daily basis.

It has an incredibly wide range of potential benefits when it comes to skincare care, but most of us aren’t using it properly or at all.

But trust me when I say that giving your skin the lightning power of retinol and vitamin C on alternate nights is absolutely worth it! 

They can be used on their own to give your skin the boost it needs especially when combined with a high-quality hyaluronic acid serum.

### 3. Vitamin C and Retinol at Night, 30 Minutes Apart

To use retinol and vitamin C effectively, you need to understand how they must be applied in a single skincare routine. 

If applied incorrectly, these products will degrade your pH levels, which will make your skin look dry and flaky.

So, you should first apply vitamin C, then wait half an hour before applying retinol.

This way, your skin can return to a normal pH level in the waiting period, allowing each ingredient to work effectively.

### 4. Vitamin C Derivative and Retinol at Night

By now, you might be aware that using retinol and vitamin C in your skincare routine is not without risks.

However, if you still want to do so, and the half-hour window period still seems a long time, you can use derivatives of vitamin C.

The derivatives of vitamin C tend to be more stable and less irritating and offer many of the same benefits (including protection from free radicals, brightening, and in some cases, even boosting collagen production).

### What if your vitamin C treatment is anhydrous (water-free)?
Anhydrous solutions are water-free generally made up of oil. In that case, you can apply retinol first, let it absorb in the skin, and follow up with Vitamin C.

You can use them on alternate nights or different skincare routines.
