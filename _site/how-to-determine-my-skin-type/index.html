    <p>The most effective way of taking care of the skin is by understanding one’s skin type. Skin care is an art and science and we all can learn this art. However, one should always know one’s skin type in order to take care of it properly.</p>

<p>While there are various products in the market that you can benefit from, but you might as well be using the wrong products for your skin unless you understand what your skin type is and what you should be giving to your skin.</p>

<p>This way, you will be taking care of your skin as well as avoiding products that might be not suitable for your skin.</p>

<p>For that, we first need to <a href="https://www.sheenycare.com/determine-your-skin-type/" target="_blank">determine our skin type</a>. Basically, there are two easy approaches to doing so.</p>

<h1 id="the-bare-faced-method">The Bare-Faced Method</h1>
<p>The bare-faced method is an easy way to determine one’s skin type. In this method, you should take a good amount of cleanser and cleanse your face for a minute. Wash off with normal water, pat your skin dry and refrain yourself from using any skin care products.</p>

<p>After 20-30 minutes, you should observe your skin. There are basically three conditions your face might be in after waiting for an hour.</p>

<p>Does your skin feel moisturized, shiny, and sticky without applying any products? You might have oily skin. Or, does your skin feels tight and strippy? This could be a sign of dry skin and does your skin feels oily at t-zone i.e the nose and the forehead and dry at other parts, you might have combination skin.</p>

<h1 id="the-blotting-sheet-method">The Blotting Sheet Method</h1>
<p>Another way of determining one’s skin type is by using a blotting paper. Gently pat a blotting paper throughout your face. Take the paper and hold it up on a visible amount of light to see through it.</p>

<p>If the paper picked up little to no oil at all, you’re most likely to have dry skin. If the blotting paper is saturated with oil, then you’re likely to have oily skin. And if the blotting paper shows a minimal amount of oil from your nose and forehead, then you might either have normal or combination skin.</p>

<p>Furthermore, if you’re skin is more prone to inflamation and irritation then you’re skin is likely to be sensitive. Like other skin types, sensitive skin is also a common skin type and issue however it is not a medical condition.</p>

<h1 id="different-skin-types">Different Skin Types</h1>
<p>Overall, we have 5 different categories. However, a single skin type need not have same skin conditions and issues. Let’s categorise all these skin conditions and talk about how to deal with them individually.</p>

<h1 id="1-normal-skin">1. Normal Skin</h1>

<p>Normal skin type is neither too dry or too oily. It has balanced sebum production that’s why normal skin type do not experience breakouts too much.</p>

<p>The blood circulation in such skin type is good and normal skin do not react bad to new products or change in weather. The skin is very firm and has minimal fine lines and wrinkles.</p>

<p>Normal skin is a very good skin type however, people with such skin type may also have sensitivity, redness and aging.</p>

<h2 id="11-normal-skin-with-sensitivity-aging-and-redness">1.1: Normal Skin with Sensitivity, Aging and Redness</h2>

<p>Such skin type are dry in winter whereas oily throughout summer. The skin is sensitive, therefore, it can react negatively to new products as well as change in season.</p>

<p>This type experience redness (rosacea) consistently and gentle exfoliation is a must. To soothe the redness and visible signs of aging in the skin, soothing nourishment should be provided.</p>

<h2 id="12-normal-skin-with-aging">1.2: Normal Skin with Aging</h2>

<p>Noraml skin type tend to be dryer when aging. Such skin type are dry and tight in winter whereas oily throughout summer. High concerntration of AHA exfoliation is required to boost cellular tunrover. Normal skin with aging requires potent antioxidant to brighten the skin complexion and prevent visible signs of aging.</p>

<h1 id="skin-care-tip-for-normal-skin">Skin Care Tip For Normal Skin</h1>

<p>A potent key for normal skin is to maintain and balance hydration level. Hence, a good hydrating serum or moisturiser is a must. Because such skin type can tolerate most ingredients, you have tons of products to choose and experience from.</p>

<h1 id="2-oily-skin">2. Oily Skin</h1>

<p>Oily skin type always seem to be glowing. The reason behind this being the greasiness due to constant seubum production. Oily skin is more prone to breakouts.</p>

<h2 id="21-oily-skin-with-clogged-pores-and-severe-breakouts">2.1: Oily Skin with Clogged Pores and Severe Breakouts</h2>
<p>Such skin experince the most breakout among all other skin types. An AHA/BHA pore clearing exfoliants either in clarifying toners or peels must be used to effectively unclog pores and reduce breakouts.</p>

<h1 id="skin-care-tip-for-oily-skin">Skin Care Tip For Oily Skin</h1>
<p>For oily skin, products with mineral oil, petrolatum and alcohol based should be avoilded. Any product that doesn’t claim to be non-comodogenic should be avoided. Hence, while choosing products, one should always choose the “non-comodogenic” ones, which would not clog pores.</p>

<p>Oil free moisturisers work great for such skin types. Chemical exfoliators tend to be gentle and they unclog the pores, hence, minimize breakouts. Clay masks also soothes the inflamation and controles the oil in the skin.</p>

<p>Also, cleanse your skin twice a day rather than over-cleaning as drying out your pores can cause them to produce even more oil.</p>

<h1 id="3-dry-skin">3. Dry Skin</h1>

<p>Dry skin type produces less sebum than normal and oily skin type. Hence, it lacks the lipids that are required to retain moisture in the skin. The skin seems flaky and the texture of the skin is rough.</p>

<h2 id="31-dry-and-dehydrated-skin">3.1: Dry and Dehydrated Skin</h2>
<p>When skin doesn’t produce lot of oil as well as do not retain enough moisture, then such skin is dry and dehydrated skin. The skin is extremely flaky, tight and appearance of fine lines and wrinkles are more visible. Water-based products help retain moisture in the skin. Also, drink plenty of water to supply water in the epidermis.</p>

<h2 id="32-dry-skin-with-aging">3.2: Dry Skin with Aging</h2>
<p>The skin with aging is dry and tight throughout the year. Due to the lack of elasticity and glow in the skin, the skin looks tired. Hence, such skin requires <a href="https://www.sheenycare.com/active-ingredients-for-skin-care/" rel="dofollow" target="_blank">active</a> and energising ingredients, firmimg peptides and a high concentration of AHA exfoliants to boost cellular turnover and even the skin complextion.</p>

<h2 id="33-dry-skin-with-damaged-skin">3.3: Dry Skin with Damaged Skin</h2>
<p>The skin with damaged skin is dry and tight throughout the year. The skin is damaged due to over exposure of skin to the sun and tends to have brown spots, broken capillaries and loss of elasticity. To even out the skin tones, brightening ingredients should be used and  AHA exfoliants to boost cellular turnover.</p>

<p>The skin with sensitivity and redness is dry and tight throughout the year along with loss of elasticity. The skin is red consistently, and gets irritated easily especially.

Furthermore, it requires calming and brightening ingredients to deal with redness.</p>

<h1 id="skin-care-tip-for-dry-skin">Skin Care Tip For Dry Skin</h1>
<p>A good moisturiser with hyaluronic acid and peptides will help seal moisture in the skin. When Caring for dry skin, a product with ingredient named Squalene is a must. Squalene helps satabilize skin’s barrier and maintain moisture. Using product with sqaulene replenishes skin for soft, smooth and healthy appearances. Also, the air around the house should be moist to help seal moisture.</p>

<h1 id="4-combination-skin">4. Combination Skin</h1>
