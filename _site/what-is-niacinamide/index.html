    <p>Have you started using <a href="https://www.sheenycare.com/active-ingredients-for-skin-care/" rel="dofollow" target="_blank">active ingredients</a> in your skin care routine or are you yet to do that? To be honest, science doesn’t lie. A lot of research backs up these ingredients in order to safely use them in our skin care regimen.</p>

<p>So, today’s topic is using <strong>Niacinamide</strong> in a skin care routine. How many of you have heard about this ingredient? If yes, how many of you have already started incorporating it in your skin care routine?</p>

<p>If you’ve just heard the name, then this article will help you know all about it. And, well, if you’ve started using it, then this article will help you give insights on where you should not be going wrong with this ingredient.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-niacinamide">What is Niacinamide?</h1>
<p>Niacinamide is also known as Nicotinamide. It is one of the two major forms of vitamin B3. Nicotamide is an essential water soluble vitamin i.e. it is not synthesized in our body and we need to eat it in order to receive it’s benefits.</p>

<h1 id="why-is-vitamin-b3-an-essential-nutrient-for-the-body">Why is Vitamin B3 an essential nutrient for the body?</h1>
<p>Our body needs Vitamin B3 (niacinamide) because it helps to make the necessary environment for the cells to keep functioning in our body. It helps carry out various processes such as metabolism, damage repair etc.</p>

<p>Vitamin B3 is an essential nutrient for our body and its deficiency can lead us to several disorders of the skin, kidneys and brain. Hence, to prevent the deficiency of it, there are supplements of vitamin B3 available in the market.</p>

<p>There is a lot research going on about this ingredient. However, the mechanism by which Vitamin B3 works in the skin is not identified completely. You should always get a prescription from the doctor before buying supplements for yourself.</p>

<p>Despite that, Niacinamide in skin care has a lot of clinical benefits when applied topically. Nowadays, it has been a promised active ingredient to help manage acne, rosacea, pigmentation issues, and wrinkles.</p>

<h1 id="niacin-and-niacinamide">Niacin and Niacinamide</h1>
<p>The name seems quite similar but both of them are <a href="https://ww5.komen.org/BreastCancer/Niacinamide/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">two different types of Vitamin B3</a>. Since our body is unable to produce niacinamide on it’s own, taking niacin supplements can help the body make niacinamide. But this only happens when there is an excessive amount of niacin in the body.</p>

<h1 id="how-do-we-get-vitamin-b3-from-foods">How do we get Vitamin B3 from foods?</h1>
<p>There are several good sources of Vitamin B3 in foods. We get them from several foods such as:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Yeast</li>
  <li>Meat</li>
  <li>Fish</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
  <li>Eggs</li>
  <li>Green vegetables</li>
  <li>Beans and</li>
  <li>Cereal grains</li>
</ol>

<p>Although we’re probably getting Vitamin B3 from our diet we do not know whether it does go into our skin or not.</p>

<h1 id="what-does-niacinamide-do-for-the-skin">What does Niacinamide do for the skin?</h1>
<p>As said earlier, it is a form of vitamin B3. It is water soluble and unlike ceramide, our body doesn’t store it. Nevertheless, using Niacinamide in skin care has many potential to improve the skin.</p>

<h2 id="1-it-stimulates-skin-barrier">1. It stimulates skin barrier:</h2>
<p>Skin barrier is the outer surface of the skin. Niacinamide strengthens the skin barrier and increases its resiliency i.e. increases the ability of the skin to recover from any damages.</p>

<h2 id="2-it-stimulates-lipid-barrier">2. It stimulates lipid barrier:</h2>
<p>When Niacinamide is applied in the skin, it helps the skin grow a lipid barrier. This lipid is made up of ceramide, which in turn helps retain moisture and hydrates the skin. Hence, if you have extremely dry skin or if your skin is mature then Niacinamide is a must for you.</p>

<h2 id="3-it-increases-the-immunity-of-the-skin">3. It increases the immunity of the skin:</h2>
<p>Niacinamide regulates keratin production. Keratin is a type of protein that keeps your skin firm and healthy.</p>

<h2 id="4-it-improves-the-texture-of-the-skin">4. It improves the texture of the skin:</h2>
<p>The texture of the skin is automatically improved when the skin is firm, smooth and moisturised. Over time, the size of the pore is reduced. Hence, Niacinamide minimizes the visibility of pores.</p>

<h2 id="5-it-minimizes-redness">5. It minimizes redness:</h2>
<p>If your have inflammatory skin conditions, eczema, acne etc then Niacinamide helps reduce the appearance of inflammation and ease redness.</p>

<h2 id="6-it-reduces-discoloration-and-hyperpigmentation">6. It reduces discoloration and hyperpigmentation:</h2>
<p>Researchers have found that using 5% Niacinamide daily can be helpful in lightening dark spots and minimizing pigmentation. Niacinamide has helped prevent or block the production of enzymes responsible for pigmentation. This enzyme is called melanin.</p>

<h2 id="7-it-minimizes-the-visibility-of-fine-lines-and-wrinkles">7. It minimizes the visibility of fine lines and wrinkles:</h2>
<p>Similarly, using the same concentration of Niacinamide has also shown to prevent premature signs of aging, that specifically comes along with sun damage. This includes, reducing the visibility of fine lines and wrinkles.</p>

<h2 id="8-it-regulates-the-oil-production">8. It regulates the oil production:</h2>
<p>Along with retaining moisture in the skin, Niacinamide regulates oil production. It controls the overproduction of oil in the sebaceous glands and prevents acne.</p>

<h2 id="9-it-prevents-acne">9. It prevents acne:</h2>
<p>Niacinamide has anti-inflammatory properties and it helps treat skin conditions like acne. Severe acne such as papules and pustules can be treated with 4% concentration of Niacinamide. Furthermore, taking oral niacinamide supplements has been shown to reduce the inflammation caused by acne and rosacea.</p>

<h2 id="10-it-protects-against-sun-damage-and-oxidative-stress">10. It protects against sun damage and oxidative stress:</h2>
<p>Niacinamide helps rebuild healthy skin cells. Healthy skin cells protect the skin from damages caused by ultraviolet rays, pollution and toxins in the environment.</p>

<h1 id="who-needs-niacinamide">Who needs Niacinamide?</h1>
<p><strong>All skin types</strong> need niacinamide. Niacinamide is typically used in people with sensitive skin or other skin conditions such as eczema or rosacea.</p>

<p>It is formulated in such a way that even people with irritation or allergies from any skin care products can use it. Hence, people with following skin issues should use Niacinamide to effectively treat it.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pores</li>
  <li>Acne</li>
  <li>Hyperpigmentation</li>
  <li>Redness</li>
  <li>Sensitivity and Irritation</li>
  <li>Eczema</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Niacinamide is safe for all skin types.</strong></p>

<h1 id="how-long-does-it-take-to-work">How long does it take to work?</h1>
<p>Research shows that Niacinamide starts working within:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>4 weeks</strong> of application in the skin to treat hyperpigmentation, redness and hydrate the skin whereas,</li>
  <li><strong>8 to 12 weeks</strong> to treat acne, fine lines and wrinkles and</li>
  <li>It takes upto <strong>2 to 6 weeks</strong> to reduce oiliness from the skin.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="how-to-get-started-with-niacinamide">How to get started with Niacinamide?</h1>
<p>Always start with products that contain low concentration (1-2%) of the ingredient first and see how your skin reacts to it before moving to a higher concentration.</p>

<h1 id="how-to-use-niacinamide-in-a-skin-care-routine">How to use Niacinamide in a skin care routine?</h1>
<p>Niacinamide is normally found in several creams and serums. The products with Niacinamide can be used both in the AM as well as PM. Sunlight has less effect on it’s potency but you should always layer it in the correct order.</p>

<p>Here’s how you can incorporate Niacinamide in your skin care routine.</p>

<h2 id="1-niacinamide-serum-after-cleansing-and-toning">1. Niacinamide Serum (After cleansing and toning):</h2>
<p>Niacinamide serums should typically be applied after cleansing and toning the face like any other serums. Since serums are usually water based they are best absorbed by the skin before any moisturizer or thick oil based serums.</p>

<p>You should apply the serum evenly throughout the face and on areas with high sebum activity.</p>

<h2 id="1-niacinamide-moisturizer-at-the-end">1. Niacinamide Moisturizer (At the end):</h2>
<p>Moisturizer with Niacinamide should be used at the end of the skin care routine after cleansing, toning and applying serum, typically like any other moisturizer but before sunscreen and makeup.</p>

<h1 id="side-effects-of-using-niacinamide-in-skin-care-routine">Side effects of using Niacinamide in skin care routine.</h1>
<p>Niacinamide is an extremely powerful active ingredient used in skin care routine. But we should be very careful while choosing the product. Products with higher concentration of Niacinamide may cause skin irritation. Also, you should not used be overusing as you can experience some redness or even worse (dermatitis).</p>

<h1 id="recommended-products-with-niacinamide">Recommended Products with Niacinamide.</h1>

</ol>

<h1 id="combining-with-other-ingredients">Combining with other ingredients.</h1>
<p>Niacinamide can be used with other ingredients for optimal benefits. Some research shows that Niacinamide works well with Zinc, Folic Acid and Copper to treat acne.</p>

<p>Whereas, combining Niacinamide with Hyaluronic Acid helps better absorption of the product.</p>

<h1 id="what-can-you-not-mix-with-niacinamide">What can you not mix with Niacinamide?</h1>
<p>Vitamin C is one ingredient that’s not compatible with niacinamide. Both of them are a common antioxidant. They are used in a variety of skincare products, but they should not be used one right after the other.</p>

<p>If they are used together their potency is significantly decreased.  The only way to use them together in a skin care routine is by spacing at least 10 minutes between each serum.</p>

<h1 id="why-is-it-the-talk-of-the-town">Why is it the talk of the town?</h1>
<p>The most common skin issues people have to face are acne,rosacea, pigmentation, fine lines and wrinkles. There are many active ingredients that target such skin issues. However, Niacinamide is claimed to be the <strong>“active ingredient”</strong> that targets all the skin issues at once and treat them.</p>

<p>Most of the studies about it have been carried out at concentrations of 5% or below. And yes, it can do everything it’s purported to: improve hyperpigmentation, fortify barrier function, normalize sebum production etc. However, we need to realize that niacinamide, and a whole host of other “actives” can do more harm than good when overused.</p>

<h1 id="tips-for-using-niacinamide-in-skin-care">Tips for using Niacinamide in skin care!</h1>
<p>Niacinamide is known as a miracle drug. But, when you use niacinamide in skin care routine, you need to be careful about over using it. Also, you have to understand your skin and the issues you have before applying niacinamide to treat them. Because not all inflammation are acne and not all redness is rosacea.</p>

<p>Let us know, how you use Niacinamide in skin care routine and tell us how has it has changed your skin and you’re lifestyle.</p>
