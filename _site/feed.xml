        <title>10 Step Korean Skin Care Routine for Evening</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Korean Skin Care routines are trendy today. The combination of innovative technology and ancient tradition has made Korean Skin Care one of the best beauty routine. Famously known as the K beauty routine, here are the 10 Korean skin care regimen for glowing skin. Now 10 steps may seem extremely long, but most Korean Women use and 8 to 12 step skin care routine daily to maintain a beautiful and healthy skin. After all, its all about having a healthy and glowing skin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-1-double-cleanser&quot;&gt;Step 1: Double Cleanser&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;oil-based-cleanser&quot;&gt;Oil Based Cleanser&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil based cleanser are used to remove oil based makeup, excess dirt, pollution, sebum and SPF from the skin. It is the first step of the double cleanse method and we use oil at first because of ites repelling property to water. Oil based cleanser are much gentler than the regular makeup wipes and harsh alohols used to wipe off everything from the face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;water-based-cleanser&quot;&gt;Water Based Cleanser&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second step to double cleanse is water based cleanser. It further removes any residue remained of oil based cleansing. When choosing a water based cleanser, choose a gentler formula that doesn;t strip or dry your skin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/innisfreehydratingcleanser.png&quot; alt=&quot;Innisfree Hydrating Cleanser&quot; title=&quot;Innisfree Hydrating Cleanser&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-2-toner&quot;&gt;Step 2: Toner&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toner helps balance the pH level of the skin, which ideally should be slightly acidic – at about 5.5. It hydrates, moisturises and balances the pH level of  the skin. Korean Toners are alcohol free and are packed with natural ingredients passed onto generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/aloe-toner.png&quot; alt=&quot;Jeju Aloe Aqua Toner&quot; title=&quot;Jeju Aloe Aqua Toner &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-3-essence&quot;&gt;Step 3: Essence&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essence is a mixture of toner and serum but a with less concentration. Essence help in moisturising your skin, and prep it for the serum and other ingredients that follows up after this step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Snail-essence.png&quot; alt=&quot;Snail Bee high content essence &quot; title=&quot;Snail Bee high content essence &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-4-ampoule&quot;&gt;Step 4: Ampoule&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ampoule is quite similar to serum but are packed with &lt;a href=&quot;https://sheenycare.com/active-ingredients-for-skin-care/&quot;&gt;active ingredients&lt;/a&gt; that are used to target specific skin concern. They are used for a specific period of time, especially when your skin needs help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/ampoule.png&quot; alt=&quot;Hydrium Triple Hyaluronic Moisture Ampoule&quot; title=&quot;Hydrium Triple Hyaluronic Moisture Ampoule&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-5-serum&quot;&gt;Step 5: Serum&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serum are packed with several active ingredients together. These serums are packed with a balanced concerntration of different active ingredients. They are specifically used for aging, skin dehydration, hyperpigmentation, dark spots etc&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/serum.png&quot; alt=&quot;Bright Potion Probiotic Power Serum&quot; title=&quot;Bright Potion Probiotic Power Serum&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-6-moisturiser&quot;&gt;Step 6: Moisturiser&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every skin care routine has one, and so does Korean skin care routine. Apply a generous amount of moisturiser to hydrate your skin. Opt for moisturisers with ceramides and pettides and do not be afraid of &lt;a href=&quot;https://sheenycare.com/tags#Controversial-Ingredients&quot;&gt;controversial ingredients.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/moisturiser.png&quot; alt=&quot;Water Drop Hydrating Moisturizer&quot; title=&quot;Water Drop Hydrating Moisturizer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-7-eye-cream&quot;&gt;Step 7: Eye Cream&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The skin around the eye is thinnest as there are no &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?channel=fs&amp;amp;client=ubuntu&amp;amp;q=sebaceous+glands&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; sebacious gland&lt;/a&gt; to produce natural oil. So a simple eye cream is used to hydrate and protect this part of the face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/eyecream.png&quot; alt=&quot;Starting Treatment Eye Cream &quot; title=&quot;Starting Treatment Eye Cream &quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-8-exfoliator&quot;&gt;Step 8: Exfoliator&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This part of the skin care routine comes only 2-3 times a week. Exfoliation helps unclog pores, promotes cell turnover and helps absorption of products into the skin. The famous gommage peels helps in dead skin removals leaving a fresh and youthful skin. Most Koreans use this  mix of botanical and fruit extracts as an exfoliator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/applesmoothiepeelinggel.png&quot; alt=&quot;Apple Smoothie Peeling Gel&quot; title=&quot;Apple Smoothie Peeling Gel&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-9-sheet-masks&quot;&gt;Step 9: Sheet Masks&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sheets masks are luxury skin care item if I may say, not only because it is aesthetic, but because they are more of an “a la carte” version of necessity. They are formulated with &lt;a href=&quot;https://sheenycare.com/active-ingredients-for-skin-care/&quot;&gt;active ingredients&lt;/a&gt; as serums. The sheet masks help recover super dry and dehydrates skin in a single use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/firmmask.png&quot; alt=&quot;Peach and Slices Firm Mask&quot; title=&quot;Peach and Slices Firm Mask&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;step-10-sleeping-masks&quot;&gt;Step 10: Sleeping Masks&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your skin regenerates itself while you’re sleeping. Sleeping masks helps boost this process so that yoo get the most out of it. Regular moisturiser does all the job, however using a good quality sleeping masks for 2-3 times a week right before bed prepares you for “the beauty sleep” that you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/peachandlily.png&quot; alt=&quot;Peach and Lily Overnight Star Sleeping Mask&quot; title=&quot;SPeach and Lily Overnight Star Sleeping Mask&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Are Silicons Safe - A guide to contoversial skin care ingredient!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The paraben free fuss is really huge. But so is using skin care products with silicone. Silicone is made from silicon (sand), oxygen and other elements. They have been used in skin care products for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-is-silicone&quot;&gt;What is Silicone?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silicone are made of completely natural ingredients but undergo chemical processing. It is used to improve the texture of skin care products. It is beneficial for the skin because of its emolliency (skin smoothing) and water loss prevention properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;controversies-on-silicone&quot;&gt;Controversies on Silicone!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term &lt;u&gt;&quot;synthetic&quot;&lt;/u&gt; is used to undermine the properties of silicone. They are said to be &lt;u&gt;&quot;unnatural&quot;&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are claimed &lt;u&gt;bad for sensitive skin&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are also said to be &lt;u&gt;toxic for the body and the environment&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Silicons are said to be &lt;u&gt;comodogenic&lt;/u&gt;, causing acne and clogged pores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;facts-about-silicone&quot;&gt;Facts About Silicone!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research upto date hasn’t showed adverse effect of silicone on humans. Definitive evidence of harm is lacking. Silicone is &lt;u&gt;hypoallergenic&lt;/u&gt; i.e. it is relatively unlikely to cause an allergic reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once and for all, for people at the back, it is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;non-comodogenic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (DOESN’T clog pores).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Silicones are &lt;u&gt;not known to sensitize skin&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is &lt;u&gt;porous&lt;/u&gt; (having minute interstices through which liquid or air may pass) and rather helps &lt;u&gt;increase penetration of other active ingredients&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Silicones are volatile, i.e, it evaporates quickly and does not penetrate pores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So next time, someone tells you silicones are bad for your skin, do not explain them why they are super good and rather slam this blog to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Are Parabens Safe - A guide to contoversial skin care ingredient!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The paraben-free label is slapped into most of the skin care brands and cosmetics products. But do you really know what is paraben and is it really harmful? Let’s dig into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-is-paraben&quot;&gt;What is Paraben?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parabens are common preservative used in personal care products as well as food. The basic use of preservative is used to expand the shelf life of a product. That is how the paraben works in skin care products. It prevents the growth of mold, fungus and bacteria in the skin care products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Methyl Paraben&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;Ethyl Paraben&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;Propyl Paraben&lt;/u&gt; and &lt;u&gt;Butyl Paraben&lt;/u&gt; are some examples of parabens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;controversies-on-parabens&quot;&gt;Controversies on Parabens!&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cancer:&lt;/strong&gt; Parabens are suspected to have caused cancer on several people. Precisely, breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Endocrine disruptor:&lt;/strong&gt; Endocrine disruptors, also known as hormonally active agents, endocrine disrupting chemicals, or endocrine disrupting compounds are chemicals that can interfere with endocrine (or hormonal) systems. These disruptions can cause cancerous tumors, birth defects, and other developmental disorders. Current literature suggests that parabens act as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), with estrogenic effects reported most often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decreased sperm count:&lt;/strong&gt; Men with high concentrations of paraben also had a larger proportion of sperm with what’s known as abnormal morphology, or unusual size or shape, that’s associated with infertility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prenatal Exposure:&lt;/strong&gt; Prenatal Exposure is a medical condition, where a fetus inside a women’s womb is exposed to unwanted factors such as drugs, radiation, chemical etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mood Diruptor:&lt;/strong&gt; Parabens can act like the hormone estrogen in the body and disrupt the normal function of hormone systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Environmental Issues:&lt;/strong&gt; Parabens have been detected in surface waters, fish and sediments as low levels of butylparaben can kill coral, according to laboratory tests (Danaovaro 2008).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;facts-about-parabens&quot;&gt;Facts About Parabens!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of controversies on parabens are not backed by enough research and facts. Research upto date hasn’t showed adverse effect by paraben on humans. As said earlier, definitive evidence of harm is lacking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, many &lt;u&gt;studies confirms safe usage of parabens&lt;/u&gt;. It is said that paraben is able to penetrate deep into the skin but studies show that &lt;u&gt;systematic contact to dermatitis from ingestion is rare&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paraben has been used for several years now and it seems to have &lt;u&gt;low toxicity&lt;/u&gt; than what it is assumed of. It is actually very &lt;u&gt;cheap&lt;/u&gt; these days given that the &lt;u&gt;chemical is very stable i.e. it doesn't react&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has &lt;u&gt;low rate of allergies&lt;/u&gt; compared to other preservatives. The allergy rate of paraben is only at &lt;u&gt;0.06%&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;so-should-we-buy-skin-care-products-with-parabens-in-them&quot;&gt;So, should we buy skin care products with parabens in them?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since there aren’t enough studies that prove parabens are harmful, what is the “paraben free” fuss really about?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;u&gt;Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR)&lt;/u&gt;, in partnership with the FDA, concluded that parabens are safe to be used in cosmetics. However, all the controversies that have been build up throughout the years about paraben has made people choose paraben free products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you still have products with parabens in them, don’t waste it and rather use it.

        <title>Skin Care For Combination Skin</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The demography of people having combination skin is high and it’s really super-common. It’s totally normal to be oily in some spots and dry in others and it may need slightly different care in different areas. Typically, there’s a mix of oily and dry areas on different parts of your face, with the t-zone (forehead, nose, and chin) being slightly too oily. I will try to include some of my favourites and no, they’re not sponsored ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that was some introduction to combination skin, wasn’t it? Hi! I am a skin enthusiast! Here, talking about me, my skin is really dry around the cheeks and the eyes, it tends to get quite oily on the rest of my face which is known as T-zone( categorised as the part of our face, mapping from forehead to nose and for me my chin area too). I do have visible pores and having an oily skin does call for some breakout here and then. I tend to keep my skin’s PH level balanced as much as I can. I never had an acne or any major pimples situation going on throughout my adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as I got to my 20’s, I can see how my skin is changing and I am now more indulged regarding my skin care. As I have seen a lot of videos and read a lot of articles regarding skin care. I have probably read and tried everything from my grandmother’s to mom’s to friend’s and dermatologist’s methods of keeping the skin healthy. I am very skeptical about my skin and I always try to do a lot of research before trying anything. Be it from anyone, literally anyone. So, I may have some ideas and tips for people who have Combination skin! Read along for some insights from me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;hydration&quot;&gt;Hydration&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, really. Water is really essential as if you were expecting anything else. Go sip your water, right now! I’m watching. Go, just do it. I am not going to tell you how important drinking water is for your healthy skin. Get that PH level balanced, babygirl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;cleanser&quot;&gt;Cleanser&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start your day by washing your entire face with a gentle cleanser, there are lots of good brands in Nepal. Personally, I use Biotique Pineapple Foaming Face Wash every morning after I do oil pulling. Yeah, I know it sounds and feels not likely great but I vouch for it. I have seen good results. Lastly, I do recommend &lt;u&gt;VLCC's Chandan/Haldi&lt;/u&gt; and &lt;u&gt;Kesar Gel Cleanser&lt;/u&gt;. I just love how it smells!
At night, wash your face with the same mild cleanser and use an exfoliator (preferably Chemical Exfoliator) twice weekly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Honorable Mentions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
THE ORDINARY Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution&lt;br /&gt;
Pixi® skintreats Glow Tonic&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;moisturiser&quot;&gt;Moisturiser&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we use a moisturiser for normal skin, our cheeks feel good, but our T-zone looks like an oil mine! I am sure we have all been there! But we still need to moisturise, using a lotion that combines mattifying ingredients (salicylic acid, silica) with oil-free hydrators (glycerin, hyaluronic acid) could be the saving grace. I use &lt;u&gt;Ahava- Essential Day Moisturiser&lt;/u&gt; for Combination Skin! It really does work wonders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Honorable Mentions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Neutrogena Hydro Boost City Shield SPF Moisturiser&lt;br /&gt;
Clean &amp;amp; Clear Oil-Free Moisturizer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;mask&quot;&gt;Mask&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What an absolute treasure! To deep-treat combination skin, use a clay mask on oily areas to draw out excess sebum, dirt, and makeup to prevent breakouts and blackheads from appearing. I use &lt;u&gt;Lotus Herbals Claywhite Face Pack&lt;/u&gt;. It’s good.
Once a week, just indulge yourself in a spot-treating face with two masks. Apply a moisturising mask to the dry areas and an oil-absorbing clay one to your T-zone. I personally love masks! I just love’em. The face before and after the mask face really gives it away.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; You can use the oil-absorbing mask up to three times a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;retinol&quot;&gt;Retinol&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know where I would be without using Retinol based serum. When you have combination skin, finding a serum that won’t sway your complexion to the extremes of oily or dry can be tricky. To play on the safe side, opt for a retinol based one – the ingredient plays well with both dry and oily skin, keeping dry patches at bay while helping to prevent clogged pores. When using a retinoid in the daytime, always follow up your retinol serum with SPF. ALWAYS! I have yet to try The Ordinary Retinol Serum - The Ordinary Granactive Retinoid. I will let you know how I feel about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Honorable Mention:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
RETINOL SERUM: THE ORDINARY GRANACTIVE RETINOID&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;blotting-papers&quot;&gt;Blotting Papers&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the weather is hot, your T-zone tends to get shiny faster than it normally would—usually by midmorning. The quickest solution: blotting papers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Honorable Mention:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Clean &amp;amp; Clear Oil Absorbing Sheets&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s tricky and it’s very important to know how to use the right products for the right areas. Also, you don’t have to have an expensive skin care routine to have the best skin! There’s quite an understatement for affordable brands that work wonders for your skin. I will try to include some of them and no, it’s not sponsored.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Seven Signs You Have Combination Skin</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When our skin is either dry or oily, taking care of it is a pretty much straightforward process. But when you’ve got a little bit of both, things start to get complicated. Hydrating creams are very hydrating, oil-absorbing masks are awfully absorbing, balancing lotions never seem to do much balancing, the irony! And that’s bad news for us. Combination skin is very tricky and confusing. Yes, it’s true rather frustrating than confusing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have the same confusion and frustration or you are trying to figure out what is a combination skin? Welcome Sister! You’re in for an enlightening reading session. Well then, put on your glasses and sip your water every time you read “Combination Skin” on this article or any other article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-do-you-know-you-have-a-combination-skin&quot;&gt;How do you know you have a combination skin?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a Simple &lt;a href=&quot;https://sheenycare.com/how-to-determine-my-skin-type&quot;&gt;Test!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wash your face and wait for 20 minutes, read some articles ( you can read our other articles too, just a heads up). Touch your T-Zone (forehead, nose, and chin), does it feel sticky or oily? Now touch the rest of your face, is it dry or normal, meaning not as oily as your T-zone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If no, then you continue reading this post as it may have things you might want to try as your skin may not be a combination skin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If yes, then sister.. you are welcome to the Combi-Bombi club! I know little over the top but who really cares, no?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;confusion-with-the-skin-products&quot;&gt;Confusion With The Skin Products?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does it ever happen when you use a moisturiser for a normal skin, it makes your cheeks feel good, but your T-zone looks like an oil mine? We have all been there. Pat yourself, you have come a long way. Use products that are water-based and are pH balanced. Yes, you still need to moisturise, but use a lotion that combines mattifying ingredients (salicylic acid, silica) with oil-free hydrators (glycerin, hyaluronic acid). That’s a must for a combination skin!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pores-did-anyone-say-pores&quot;&gt;Pores? Did anyone say Pores?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trust me, if I hear and see anyone say I have large pores, I’m gonna take care of it. That should be your mindset. If you have pores on your T-Zone greater than the pores around your cheeks or chin then yes, you do have a combination skin! Though nothing has been proven to actually shrink pores, there is a way to make them look smaller. Dermatologists recommend applying products containing retinol, alpha hydroxy acid, or beta hydroxy acid, which help keep pores from getting clogged and at bay. Great news, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;does-it-snow-dandruffs&quot;&gt;Does it snow? (Dandruffs)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How often does it snow in your place? Often? Not quite? Snow as in Dandruff, gals. You are most likely to have dandruffs and have dry, flaky patches on your scalp. It isn’t a definite indicator but yeah most people tend to have the problem. Use a better and anti-dandruff shampoo to get rid of your snow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dry-patches-and-breakouts&quot;&gt;Dry Patches and Breakouts?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tell me about another greater duo beside the guys above. Having a Combi-Bombi Skin, breakouts along with dry patches are the worst thing that can happen to anyone. Use two types of masks, a moisturising and a mattifying one. They can help you with the troubles. Use a clay mask if it’s available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hows-the-weather&quot;&gt;How’s the weather?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The skin mostly reacts to the environment around where you spend most of your time. If it’s hotter you’ll be a glistening god/goddess by mid morning. Always use a blotting paper to avoid having excess oil from your personal oil mine.. kidding!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dry-patches-around-your-t-zone&quot;&gt;Dry Patches around your T-Zone?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they have a little bit of yellowness to them, and the skin underneath looks pink and inflamed, you may have seborrheic dermatitis. This condition is often confused with dry skin, but it is an overgrowth of yeast that normally grows on the scalp. People often have dandruff along with it. To clear it up, see your dermatologist, who may prescribe antifungal, anti-yeast, or anti-inflammatory creams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These signs have truth in them, if you have any signs from above. You’re mostly having a combination skin. If you want to know further more about the skin you have, it’s always the better option to visit your dermatologist and get a clear vision about your skin!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Guide To Active Skin Care Ingredients</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-exactly-are-actives&quot;&gt;What exactly are ‘actives’?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long answer short, if you have acne, your’e looking for products that deals with acne, if you have hyperpigmentation, you’re looking for products that deals with it. Hence, ‘actives’ are those ingredients in a product that deals with a specific skin condition or whatever skin concern it is meant to target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re new to the skin care world, you probably would want to know what actives are and why you should be adding them to your skin care regimen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;as-said-above-an-active-are-those-ingredients-that-contains-an-active-ingredient-in-them&quot;&gt;As said above, an active are those ingredients that contains an active ingredient in them.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk parallely about the ingredients and skin concerns we must be using them for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;alpha-hydroxy-acids-aha-exfoliate&quot;&gt;Alpha Hydroxy Acids (AHA): Exfoliate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AHA a class of chemical exfoliants are a good news to even sensitive skin as they are super safe to use. Common AHA’s such as &lt;u&gt;Glycolic Acid&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;Lactic Acid&lt;/u&gt; and &lt;u&gt;Mandelic Acid&lt;/u&gt; are used abundantly these days in all kinds of products such as cleansers, toners, masks and creams to loosen dead skin cells and smooth the skin. Unlike using physical exfoliators directly to your face, chemical exfoliators are much gentler, as you do not need to scrub them harshly in your skin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;beta-hydroxy-acids-bha-clear-breakouts&quot;&gt;Beta Hydroxy Acids (BHA): Clear Breakouts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BHA’s specifically are acne treating ingredients. Commonly used Salicylic Acid is a part of beta hydroxy acid and today is a part of every skin care product that deals with acne and breakouts. &lt;u&gt;Salicylic Acid&lt;/u&gt; is known to remove dead skin cells by getting deep into your pores and cleaning it. Because salicylic acid is a non comodogenic ingredient, it is more likely to loosen blackheads and clear pores. Also, it is not irritating to your skin as compared to benzoyl peroxide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;vitamin-c-brigten-skin&quot;&gt;Vitamin C: Brigten Skin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitamin C is commonly found in various fruits and also sold as dietary supplements. Vitamin C is an essential nutrient involved in the repair of tissue and the enzymatic production of certain neurotransmitters. It is also known as ascorbic acid and has a huge role in collagen synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vitamic C is a vital molecule for skin health. The antioxidant properties of vitamin C has been proved to improve the efficiency of sunscreen if layered underneath it to help prevent and treat ultraviolet (UV)-induced photodamage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;retinol-firm-and-smooth-skin&quot;&gt;Retinol: Firm and Smooth Skin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retinol is a vitamin A derivative with multiple skin benefits such as skin cell turnover, unclogging pores, smooth skin, refine skin textures and lighten age spots. It is a must use ingredient in skin care regimen after 20 as it is also known for its ability to treat fine lines, wrinkles as well as acne. Hence, Retinol could be “the anti-aging” ingredient that has ever been discovered till date. This ingredient could be drying to some skin types and on that note, you have to consult to your dermatologist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not be confused with Retin A and Tretinoin as Retinol is a derivative of Vitamin A whereas Retin-A and Tretinoin are vitamin A.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hyaluronic-acid-hydrate&quot;&gt;Hyaluronic Acid: Hydrate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyaluronic Acid has an amazing molecular property of holding up to 1,000 times its weight in water. Hyaluronic acid, also called as hyaluron is a clear, silky smooth substance that is naturally produced by the body. It is able to improve the texture of the skin as well as its apperance.
Our body naturally decreases the production of Hyaluronic acid in our body after 30, which is why it is also a powerful anti-aging skin care ingredient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;niacinamide-reudce-inflamation&quot;&gt;Niacinamide: Reudce Inflamation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Niacinamide is a form of Vitamin B-3. It has anti-inflammatory properties and antioxidant properties. A lot of dermatologists ask you to apply topical niacinamide-based products to treat hyperpigmentation, acne and rosacea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ceramids-improve-barrier-function&quot;&gt;Ceramids: Improve Barrier Function&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ceramides are lipids that help form the skin’s barrier and help skin retain moisture. A healthy skin barrier is a must for obtaining helathy skin and ceramides help you fortify it. Ceramides are also naturally produced by the body. And if theres enough of it, your skin will automatically fight to keep pollutions and dirts out. What cermaide does is make a “water-proof barrier” in the upper layer of the skin. They help in regulating cells and repairing skin’s natural barrier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cermaide production decreases with age. Hence, make sure to use ceramide-based moisturiser. By doing so, you will help your skin form ceramides on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;peptides-boosts-collagen&quot;&gt;Peptides: Boosts Collagen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A peptide is a short chain of amino acids. They basically communicate between skin cells. They occur naturally and help regulate hormonal activity, activate or deactivate immune responses, and stimulate wound healing. Regular application of peptides will boost your collagen production, stop collagen degradation and relax the wrinkles ultimately making your skin look younger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;vitamin-e-protect&quot;&gt;Vitamin E: Protect&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitamin E are typically used in skin care ingredients especially in collaboration with Vitamin C to stabilize the unsbale formulation of Vitamin C. Vitamin E are also naturally found in human skin, but are depriciated due to the constant exposure of skin in the sun and other nevironmantal factors. Adding Vitamin E in your skin care regimen will be give an extra protection to your skin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;curcuminoids-glow&quot;&gt;Curcuminoids: Glow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever heard of using turmeric to improve your skin, it is because turmeric consists of Curcuminoids in its powerhouse. It has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. It is able to give you the glow you want when regularly incorporated in your diet. The skin brightening properties of turmeric can be achieved by looking for capsules that pair curcuminoids with more easily digested lipids for better absorption.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Skin Care Routine for Dry Skin</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hydrating Cleanser:&lt;/strong&gt;
Use a very gentle but hydrating cleanser for about a minute to cleanse your skin.
Something as gentle as the &lt;u&gt;Himalaya moisturizing aloe vera face wash&lt;/u&gt; is a blessing to your skin. And if you would want to steep a little high, opt for a &lt;u&gt;cetaphil gentle skin cleanser&lt;/u&gt;. Just make sure the product you’re using doesn’t let your skin feel tight and stripping after the wash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;CeraVe's Hydrating Facial Cleanser&lt;/u&gt;, which includes ceramides and hyaluronic acid, has been internationally renowned today and seems to be the favourite cleanser for all. And for those who suffer with redness, consider products with niacinamide as it aids with inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cleansing Tip for extremely dry skin:&lt;/strong&gt;
Skip using a cleanser and just wash your face with normal water(not too cold, not too hot) to wash your face in the morning. Avoid foaming cleansers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hydrating Toner:&lt;/strong&gt;
If you have sensitive skin, it is suggested to go easy with toners. It is not required necessarily, especially because most toners are full of alcohol and unwanted chemicals that are likely to harm your skin. I personally recommend using a gentle toner in your skin that is packed with good hydrating ingredients such as Hyaluronic Acid that would lock up all the moisture in your skin. If serums seem to exceed your budget, opt for a toner with hyaluronic acid.
&lt;u&gt;Neutrogena's Alcohol Free Hydrating Toner&lt;/u&gt; can be your best pick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toning Tip for dry skin:&lt;/strong&gt;
Skip this step if the ingredient list on the toner you’re using seems to do nothing at all. Also, stop spending your money on Mario Badescu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serum:&lt;/strong&gt;
Serums are packed with concentrated ingredients and especially in the morning, you have to choose an antioxidant protection serum such as Vitamin C. Vitamin C does wonders to your skin. Vitamin C serum from &lt;u&gt;DermaFix&lt;/u&gt; aids your skin beautifully despite a slight fragnace in it. But the ingredient list completely satisfies why it does have fragnance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for night, a serum with retinol is a good option. “Retinols can also be applied in serum-form; bakuchiol, a naturally derived retinol is often more tolerable for dry skin.” Start with a minimum concentrate retinols. You can start with &lt;u&gt;Tretin-A, 0.025%,&lt;/u&gt; which is easily available in your nearest drugstore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serum Tip for dry skin:&lt;/strong&gt;
Invest in Hyaluronic Acid Serum as retinol is a drying ingredient that has plenty of benefits to your skin. Since you can’t avoid retinols, you have to have good hydratings serums with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moisturizer:&lt;/strong&gt;
You need a good moisturizer to hydrate the skin, regardless of the skin type. A good moisturizer for dry skin should have ceramides that does wonders to the skin. Something as gentle as the cerave moisturiser works best for the skin. &lt;u&gt;Cerave, cetaphil, lubriderm&lt;/u&gt; are few of the best dermatologists approved moisturisers for your dry skin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moisturizer Tip for dry skin:&lt;/strong&gt;
Never buy products with parabens and denatured alcohol, ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, or benzyl alcohol. These are meant to penetrate your skin deeper but ultimately results you with breakouts and drier skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eye Cream:&lt;/strong&gt;
Since the under-eye area is more sensitive than others, it’s a lot drier, too. To protect the delicate area, be sure to use a rich eye cream every night before bed. If you’re using a good moisturiser and are short of budget, you may skip this step because eye creams are quite expensive.
&lt;u&gt;Himalaya Under Eye Cream&lt;/u&gt; however can fit right in your budget. However, &lt;u&gt;Cerave's&lt;/u&gt; under eye cream can be your best pick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunscreen:&lt;/strong&gt;
No matter what, do not skip this step in the AM. You have to wear your sunscreen no matter if youre staying indoors or even wearing makeup. No matter the season, you need to keep your skin safe from the environment. Consider a serum-like formula that won’t give you a streaky white finish.
When buying one, always buy spf 50++.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Neutrogena's&lt;/u&gt; suncreen and &lt;u&gt;La Roche Posay's&lt;/u&gt; spf 50++ are the best pick sunscreen for dry skin. Also, &lt;u&gt;Cerave&lt;/u&gt; can never be out of this list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- To the south, it is bounded by the Sahel, a belt of **semi-arid tropical savanna** around the Niger River valley and the Sudan Region of Sub-Saharan Africa. The Sahara can be divided into several regions including: the western Sahara, the central Ahaggar Mountains, the Tibesti Mountains, the Aïr Mountains, the Ténéré desert, and the Libyan Desert.

For several hundred thousand years, the Sahara has alternated between desert and savanna grassland in a 20,000 year cycle caused by the precession of the Earth's axis as it rotates around the Sun, which changes the location of the North African Monsoon. The area is next expected to become green in about 15,000 years (17,000 AD). --&gt;
