    <p>Skincare is not that hard, especially when you know what your skin wants.</p>

<p>If the demand and supply are always on balance, you most probably will have the healthiest skin in the room.</p>

<p>Before starting, I have a quick exercise for you. What you need to do is wash your face with a cleanser and check if it feels super tight and a moisturizer would help your skin instantly.</p>

<p>If yes, <a href="https://www.sheenyskincare.com/what-is-dry-skin/" target="_blank">then you have dry skin</a>.  If are unsure about your skin type, <a href="https://www.sheenyskincare.com/how-to-determine-my-skin-type/" target="_blank">you can find it here right now</a>.</p>

<p>The next step is to help you pick the best yet affordable product for dry skin available in the market to help you create a perfect <a href="https://www.sheenyskincare.com/skin-care-routine-for-dry-skin/" target="_blank">skin care routine</a> for dry skin.</p>

<h2 id="best-skincare-products-for-dry-skin">Best skincare products for dry skin.</h2>

<h3 id="1-cetaphil-gentle-skin-cleanser-1155">1. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GC74LL5/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=sheenycare-20&amp;linkCode=w00&amp;linkId=39cb6a2561603724e63ea0bf03976d5b&amp;creativeASIN=B07GC74LL5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser ($11.55)</a></h3>
<p>Let me share a story I have with the Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser.</p>

<p>So my local pharmacy had either a 250ml pack or a 500ml pack. And I knew instantly that I would order the 500ml one.</p>

<p>The next day I got a phone call from them and they said they either have a 250ml or a 1000ml pack.</p>

<p>Now the point here is since this is my go-to cleanser, 250ml would be quite a small amount. On the other hand, 1000ml my friend wasn’t a joke either.</p>

<p>But my love for this gentle, hydrating, soothing cleanser is so strong that I had to buy the family pack.</p>

<p>This gentle face wash is suitable for all skin types but is ideal for dry, sensitive skin.</p>

<p>A little fun fact, researchers say that dry skin can be inherited and since dry skin runs in my family, this cleanser has been perfect for my entire family.</p>

<p>The formula is pH balanced, fragrance-free, and hypoallergenic.</p>

<p>My dermatologist also recommended this to me and I will definitely repurchase this again and again.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/cetaphil-gentle-skin-cleanser.webp" alt="Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser" title="Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser" /></p>

<h3 id="2-cerave-hydrating-facial-cleanser-1464">2. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MSSDEPK/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=sheenycare-20&amp;linkCode=w00&amp;linkId=4cba6458ea95de36dab25f8fe88aac73&amp;creativeASIN=B01MSSDEPK" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser ($14.64)</a></h3>
<p>Remember when Cerave was super hyped? Like everyone was talking about it.</p>

<p>Every dermatologist on Instagram and TikTok was going crazy about it, skincare estheticians couldn’t stop recommending it? That is when I decided to buy one.</p>

<p>This gentle cleansing lotion contains hyaluronic acid, essential ceramides, and glycerin to help hydrate skin without stripping out the moisture.</p>

<p>This gentle cleansing lotion contains <a href="https://www.sheenyskincare.com/hyaluronic-acid-skin-benefits-uses" target="_blank">hyaluronic acid</a>, essential <a href="https://www.sheenyskincare.com/what-is-ceramide" target="_blank">ceramides</a>, and glycerin to help hydrate skin without stripping out the moisture.</p>

<p>I will not lie but there was a time when I would only choose skincare that had hyaluronic acid and ceramides in it.</p>

<p>But this combination actually works great right? If you have never used it, you must now, because the hydration this product gives after cleansing is a bomb.</p>

<p>And I live by cleansers that leave my skin moisturized, non-greasy, and smooth after washing them off.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a similar experience and are sick of cleansers drying out your skin, then this cleanser is for you.</p>

<h3 id="3-banila-clean-it-zero-1754">3. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BSV1T35/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=sheenycare-20&amp;linkCode=w00&amp;linkId=ba53b295b793f08672bb8aa804fef511&amp;creativeASIN=B07BSV1T35" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Banila Clean It Zero ($17.54)</a></h3>

<p>Be honest with me, okay, how much is double cleansing important to you?</p>

<p>If you are new to this concept, then let me give you a heads up.</p>

<p>So every morning, we apply sunscreen. We reapply it as well. We further put some makeup on. Let’s skip the pollution and the oil buildup part.</p>

<p>If we look at the composition of the sunscreen or makeup, they are mostly oil-based.</p>

<p>So if you only try to remove it with a cleanser, it might be a little hard to get that matte lipstick or your mascara off.</p>

<p>An oil cleanser does this job properly because the oil in this cleanser will melt all of your sunscreen and makeup.</p>

<p>In a quest to find the best oil cleanser, my result was Banila’s clean-it zero oil cleanser.</p>

<p>Its main ingredients are emulsifying alcohol and palm oil, and it doesn’t leave residue on the skin.</p>

<p>Let me be a little honest to fragrance folk out there, cause yeah, it has some.</p>

<p>Don’t come at me, because I know your body wash has an amazing smell too, and I’ll guarantee you will enjoy taking your makeup off with this product.</p>

<p>Oil cleansing should be the first step of your evening skincare routine. Follow up with a gentle cleanser to remove any residue left after oil cleansing.</p>

<h3 id="4-loreal-paris-skincare-10-pure-vitamin-c-serum-1301">4. <a href="https://amzn.to/34lIqla" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">L’Oreal Paris Skincare 10% Pure Vitamin C Serum ($13.01)</a></h3>

<p>If you are not quite sure you need a vitamin C serum, then I’ll help you sort it out for good.</p>

<p>Sunscreen will prevent the harmful rays of the sun from damaging your skin. On the other hand, what do we do about the free radicals in the environment?</p>

<p>I know I lost you in free radicals, but hang on.</p>

<p>Free radicals are single radicals, yet to be paired with another free radical. So if they are comparatively higher in number, then they start doing damage.</p>

<p>Vitamin C is an antioxidant, which pairs up with the free radical to make it complete.</p>

<p>This will significantly decrease the damage to the skin. Which will in turn helps build collagen, and fights dark spots.</p>

<p>After using a gentle cleanser, two drops of L’Oreal Paris Skincare 10% Pure Vitamin C Serum will definitely help brighten your skin and give you the glow you have been waiting for.</p>

<h3 id="5-la-roche-posay-cicaplast-balm-b5-healing-ointment-1499">5. <a href="https://amzn.to/3GHWZNm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Balm B5, Healing Ointment ($14.99)</a></h3>
<p>Disclaimer to my readers, this is not a moisturizer.</p>

<p>Yes, you read it right, it isn’t. In fact, it’s a healing product that immediately soothes irritated skin and helps heal super dry, cracked, or rough skin.</p>

<p>This product has a 100% potential of being your next holy grail because a pea-size amount will immediately work for your burning red and sensitive skin.</p>

<p>Or if you happen to over-exfoliate your skin, and if your skin starts to burn, this product is your rescue.</p>

<p>However, you should not treat this product as a moisturizer. This is a treatment, and you can layer your favorite moisturizer on top of it.</p>

<p>In fact, when my dad went to a derm for his eczema-prone skin checkup, he bought this one back home. Ever since that, this product has been my mom’s favorite too.</p>

<p>You can label this product as a rescue balm to all of your life’s problems as well.</p>

<h3 id="6-cerave-daily-moisturizing-lotion-for-dry-skin-1778">6. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RK4HST7/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=sheenycare-20&amp;linkCode=w00&amp;linkId=e409f50f737201d80c4cf1320bea514e&amp;creativeASIN=B07RK4HST7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion for Dry Skin ($17.78)</a></h3>

<p>Cerave and fine wine are the same. The more the merrier.</p>

<p>It has a smooth, light-weight texture that is quickly absorbed by the skin.</p>

<p>It even contains Hyaluronic Acid to hold onto natural moisture of the skin and ceramides to help restore and maintain the skin’s natural barrier.</p>

<p>When the skin barrier (outermost layer of your skin) is strong, your skin will automatically be healthy.</p>

<p>This is why the moisturizer you choose should always have repairing properties like cerave, which helps in building an excellent barrier of the skin.</p>

<p>If you wish to have a thicker consistency than that of the daily moisturizing lotion, then you can opt for 
<a href="https://amzn.to/3gGbeaz" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CeraVe Moisturizing Cream</a></p>

<h3 id="7-la-roche-posay-toleriane-ultra-cream-1499">7. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N9SPQHQ/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=sheenycare-20&amp;linkCode=w00&amp;linkId=5191eb7e2676d7ad7d56198e652ce591&amp;creativeASIN=B01N9SPQHQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">La Roche Posay Toleriane Ultra Cream ($14.99)</a></h3>

<p>I first tried this moisturizer when I once in a while have an urge to try products that I have never used before.</p>

<p>My friend from Australia sent me a package of La Roche Posay and well I have turned out to absolutely love it.</p>

<p>I even recommend this to people with oily skin because the formulation is too good to be true for all skin types.</p>

<p>I also have met few people who specifically order this product if they have dry and acne prone skin because nothing else works for their skin type.</p>

<p>This face moisturizer provides up to 48-hour hydration and helps restore the skin’s barriers.</p>

<p>It is also non comedogenic i.e it won’t clog pores which is why it’s perfect for people with dry skin.</p>

<p>It is formulated with a high concentration of Prebiotic Thermal Water, Ceramide-3, Niacinamide &amp; Glycerin.</p>

<p>Ceramides are the building block of our skin, and niacinamide helps repair our skin from damage, which is an excellent pair for a moisturizer.</p>

<p>If you are searching for a gentle moisturizer that does the job, then you should definitely have la roche posay toleriance moisturizer on your shelf.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/larocheposaymoisturizer.webp" alt="La Roche Posay Toleriane Ultra Cream" title="La Roche Posay Toleriane Ultra Cream" /></p>

<h3 id="8-the-ordinary-hyaluronic-acid-1200">8. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071WJWSRS/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=sheenycare-20&amp;linkCode=w00&amp;linkId=6bdddbdd52bc5ad19535076f27bd317b&amp;creativeASIN=B071WJWSRS" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid ($12.00)</a></h3>
<p>Well, finally we come down to the holy grail skincare ingredient for dry skin. If you have dry and dehydrated skin at the same time, then you need this product.</p>

<p>Hyaluronic Acid is one of the best ingredients for dry, dehydrated skin and my personal favorite is the one from the ordinary.</p>

<p>Now, what we need to understand yet again is that Hyaluronic Acid is not a moisturizing ingredient rather it is a hydrating ingredient.</p>

<p>Our body naturally produces it but with age, the amount of natural HA decreases in our body and that is why we need to apply it topically.</p>

<p>This product is also formulated with Vitamin B5 (water soluble vitamin) which also enhances hydration on the skin.</p>

<p>We find many products in the market these days which claim to have HA in them.</p>

<p>However, HA is too large a molecule to penetrate the skin and instead stays on the top of the skin.</p>

<p>This is also one of the reasons why our skin feels smooth and soft after the application.</p>

<p>Make sure to apply this on damp skin and wait until it multiplies by reacting with water to give you the hydration your skin needs.</p>

<p>You can also check if hyaluronic acid is working for you or not.</p>

<p>Simply try to check the effect it does on your skin. If it feels plump and glowy then it is working for you.</p>

<p>If it feels like it did nothing to your skin, then your skin is probably already hydrated.</p>

<p>However, it will still work to improve fine lines, and prevent future dehydration.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/ordinary-hyaluronic-acid.webp" alt="The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid " title="The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid " /></p>

<h3 id="9-la-roche-posay-anthelios-tinted-sunscreen-spf-50-3350">9. <a href="https://amzn.to/3svnTCU" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">La Roche-Posay Anthelios Tinted Sunscreen SPF 50 ($33.50)</a></h3>

<p>If you have some bad experiences with mineral sunscreens and chemical sunscreen stung your eyes all the time, then this product will not fail your expectations.</p>

<p>It is a tinted mineral sunscreen. It has bb cream like color and is super fluid.</p>

<p>This product is excellent for dry as well as sensitive skin. Since it is tinted, it leaves no white cast.</p>

<p>It doesn’t feel heavy on the skin, i.e. it is extremely lightweight.</p>

<p>I often feel that most sunscreens have a hard time absorbing, but this absorbs instantly.</p>

<p>The color is perfect for my fair light skin. If you are fairer, then you might feel like it wont settle properly on your skin, but the color wouldn’t matter after application.</p>

<p>You can almost feel like the color of this sunscreen is transparent.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/la-roche-posay-sunscreen.webp" alt="La Roche-Posay Anthelios Tinted Sunscreen SPF 50" title="La Roche-Posay Anthelios Tinted Sunscreen SPF 5" /></p>

<h3 id="10-neutrogena-ultra-sheer-dry-touch-sunscreen-797">10. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000EPA4GQ/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=sheenycare-20&amp;linkCode=w00&amp;linkId=ab7309e43e4d9997ee6340578126dc4d&amp;creativeASIN=B000EPA4GQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunscreen ($7.97)</a></h3>

<p>I often switch between the cetaphil sheer sunscreen and Neutrogena’s Sheer Dry-Touch Sunscreen.</p>

<p>I was quite impressed with this product provided the cost and it literally prevented sunburn.</p>

<p>I also like it because it has so far never made me breakout for once.</p>

<p>I also liked the antioxidant complex in this product that claims to protect the skin from free radical damage.
The product doesn’t leave any white cast and is fragrance free.</p>

<p>Well, my mom also started using this under my influence and she thinks that using this sunscreen has helped to lighten pigmentation on her face.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/neutrogena-dry-touch-sunscreen.webp" alt="Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunscreen " title="Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunscreen" /></p>

<p>If you have dry skin and are using any other products that has worked for you then do mention them in the comment section.</p>

<p>If you would want to know more dupes of expensive skin care products, I will soon come up with such collections as well. Furthermore, the links in this posts are affiliate links and I might get a certain amount of commission on any purchase through the link.</p>
