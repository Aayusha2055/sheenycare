    "body": "2020/09/16 - Dear Mens, if your’e new to skin care then the first and foremost thing you must do is to determine your skin type. Once you know you’re skin type, it really gets easy to create a skin care routine. You will be able to choose the right skin care products based on your skin type. Let’s look at 5 easy skin care routine for men that is super easy to use in our daily life. Skin Care Routine for MenStep 1: CleanseEvery skin care routine starts with cleansing the skin. Cleansing the skin removes dirts and pollution from the skin. You can choose a gentle cleanser based on your skin type and cleanse the skin for about 30 seconds. You need not buy expensive cleansers because you’re ultimately washing it off with water.  Step 2: ExfoliateExfoliation helps remove dirt and excess sebum production from the skin. There are generally two ways of exfoliating the skin.    Chemical Exfoliation: If you have sensitive skin that gets irritated quickly, use a chemical exfoliator. Let the exfoliator stay for few minutes in the skin to do its work and then rinse it off with luke warm water. Chemical exfoliation penetrates the skin and cleanses it from the inside.     Physical Exfoliation: Physically exfoliating the skin could be very harsh to your skin. You are likely to breakout and have irritations and redness if your skin cannot tolerate it. It is suggested to use a chemical exfoliator rather than the physical one.  You do not need to exfoliate the skin everyday as overusing active ingredients will not do any good to your skin.  Step 3: SerumSerum are packed with balanced concerntration of different active ingredients together. They are specifically used for aging, skin dehydration, hyperpigmentation, dark spots etc. Choose a lightweight serum based on the skin issues you need to tackle. Step 4: MoisturiseYou should always wear a moisturizer as it helps to hydrate the skin as well as create a protective barrier around the skin. If you’re having a problem choosing the right moisturiser for you then you should first understand your skin type and the weather condition youre living in. Therefore, you’re likely to be more dry in the winter than in the summer. Opt for moisturisers with ceramides and pettides and do not be afraid of controversial ingredients.  Step 5: SPFWe are constantlye exposed to the sun. Protecting the skin from the UV rays is a must. If you’re exposed to natural light without any protection, you’re skin is likely to get damaged. Hence, sunscreen is a mandatory product. Apply and reapply as per your skin condition and exosure to the sun.  "

    "body": "2020/09/12 - If you are a skin enthusiast you must have heard or read somewhere about this magical substance named Hyaluronic Acid!Putting it simply, Hyaluronic acid is the key to instantly plumping fine lines and making skin look all glowy. It can be found in everything from serums to sheet masks, but what exactly is it?Here are some insights to Hyaluronic Acid including the right way to incorporate it into your skincare routine. What is Hyaluronic Acid?Hyaluronic acid (HA) is actually a sugar present naturally in our skin that holds water and helps keep it hydrated. The Hyaluronic Acid within our bodies holds a thousand times its weight in water. It retains all that moisture in our skin and joints. It also prevents all that moisture from evaporating into the air. Cool, right? Just like collagen and elastin, the amount of naturally-occurring hyaluronic acid in our bodies decreases as we get older. There are, however, ways to help stimulate the production of HA in our bodies. Balanced DietAntioxidantsWater Hyaluronic Acid is a Super Humectant!Hyaluronic acid brings moisture to the surface of your skin when used in skin care products like creams and serums. It can be used as a humectant in your skincare routine because of its ability to hold water. Hence, it continually keeps the skin moisturized throughout the day. Pairing HA with other Ingredients!Hyaluronic acid plays well with most other ingredients and is great while pairing with chemical peels, retinol, vitamins, and other acids. The only exception would be acids with low pH levels, like glycolic acid. It may pollute the HA and make it ineffective. Picking up right HA!Picking the right hyaluronic acid product is really tricky. The molecule is often times too large to effectively deliver hydration deep into skin layers. The molecule is micronized i. e. it penetrates the skin in order to be effective. Otherwise, you are just putting it on top of the skin without it being helpful, obviously! Is HA Injectable?Trust me everyone is skeptical about injecting anything on their body. With a few pricks of a needle, the gel plumps sunken areas, smooths fine lines, and decreases shadows. Then, slowly the gel dissolves over time. In fillers, HA is bound in a gel carrier that holds it in place where it is in use as an injection. The hyaluronic acid creates volume because it draws in water to the area, creating a filling effect. Still skeptical? Side effects are minimal: you may experience some swelling or bruising that can last for two or three days. The most important thing to remember when getting any kind of filler or injectable. Please go to a trained and board-certified dermatologist or plastic surgeon. Why is HA everyone’s favorite?Hyaluronic acid is something our bodies already produce, it’s considered to be safe for use in all types of injectables. Take the liquid nose job, for example, dermatologists use filler to even out bumps in the nose and improve the shape, or even to improve foot pain in patients who have lost the cushioning in their heels. It can be injected into the feet to improve the padding on the bone and decrease pain. Hyaluronic Acid has many benefits for your skin! For all skin types. If you want to learn about the magical stuff it does, you should definitely check-up with your near and dear Dermatologist. "

    "body": "2020/09/09 - Korean Skin Care routines are trendy today. The combination of innovative technology and ancient tradition has made Korean Skin Care one of the best beauty routine. Famously known as the K beauty routine, here are the 10 Korean skin care regimen for glowing skin. Now 10 steps may seem extremely long, but most Korean Women use and 8 to 12 step skin care routine daily to maintain a beautiful and healthy skin. After all, its all about having a healthy and glowing skin. Step 1: Double CleanserOil Based Cleanser: Oil based cleanser are used to remove oil based makeup, excess dirt, pollution, sebum and SPF from the skin. It is the first step of the double cleanse method and we use oil at first because of ites repelling property to water. Oil based cleanser are much gentler than the regular makeup wipes and harsh alohols used to wipe off everything from the face. Water Based Cleanser: The second step to double cleanse is water based cleanser. It further removes any residue remained of oil based cleansing. When choosing a water based cleanser, choose a gentler formula that doesn;t strip or dry your skin.  Step 2: TonerToner helps balance the pH level of the skin, which ideally should be slightly acidic – at about 5. 5. It hydrates, moisturises and balances the pH level of the skin. Korean Toners are alcohol free and are packed with natural ingredients passed onto generations.  Step 3: EssenceEssence is a mixture of toner and serum but a with less concentration. Essence help in moisturising your skin, and prep it for the serum and other ingredients that follows up after this step.  Step 4: AmpouleAmpoule is quite similar to serum but are packed with active ingredients that are used to target specific skin concern. They are used for a specific period of time, especially when your skin needs help.  Step 5: SerumSerum are packed with several active ingredients together. These serums are packed with a balanced concerntration of different active ingredients. They are specifically used for aging, skin dehydration, hyperpigmentation, dark spots etc Step 6: MoisturiserEvery skin care routine has one, and so does Korean skin care routine. Apply a generous amount of moisturiser to hydrate your skin. Opt for moisturisers with ceramides and pettides and do not be afraid of controversial ingredients.  Step 7: Eye CreamThe skin around the eye is thinnest as there are no sebacious gland to produce natural oil. So a simple eye cream is used to hydrate and protect this part of the face.  Step 8: ExfoliatorThis part of the skin care routine comes only 2-3 times a week. Exfoliation helps unclog pores, promotes cell turnover and helps absorption of products into the skin. The famous gommage peels helps in dead skin removals leaving a fresh and youthful skin. Most Koreans use this mix of botanical and fruit extracts as an exfoliator.  Step 9: Sheet MasksSheets masks are luxury skin care item if I may say, not only because it is aesthetic, but because they are more of an “a la carte” version of necessity. They are formulated with active ingredients. as serums. The sheet masks help recover super dry and dehydrates skin in a single use.  Step 10: Sleeping MasksYour skin regenerates itself while you’re sleeping. Sleeping masks helps boost this process so that yoo get the most out of it. Regular moisturiser does all the job, however using a good quality sleeping masks for 2-3 times a week right before bed prepares you for “the beauty sleep” that you want.  "

    "body": "2020/09/08 - The paraben free fuss is really huge. But so is using skin care products with silicone. Silicone is made from silicon (sand), oxygen and other elements. They have been used in skin care products for years. What is Silicone?Silicone are made of completely natural ingredients but undergo chemical processing. It is used to improve the texture of skin care products. It is beneficial for the skin because of its emolliency (skin smoothing) and water loss prevention properties. Controversies on Silicone!The term  synthetic  is used to undermine the properties of silicone. They are said to be  unnatural . They are claimed bad for sensitive skin. They are also said to be toxic for the body and the environment. Silicons are said to be comodogenic, causing acne and clogged pores. Facts About Silicone!Research upto date hasn’t showed adverse effect of silicone on humans. Definitive evidence of harm is lacking. Silicone is hypoallergenic i. e. it is relatively unlikely to cause an allergic reaction. Once and for all, for people at the back, it is non-comodogenic (DOESN’T clog pores). Silicones are not known to sensitize skin. It is porous (having minute interstices through which liquid or air may pass) and rather helps increase penetration of other active ingredients. Silicones are volatile, i. e, it evaporates quickly and does not penetrate pores.  So next time, someone tells you silicones are bad for your skin, do not explain them why they are super good and rather slam this blog to them. "

    "title": "Are Parabens Safe - A guide to contoversial skin care ingredient!",
    "body": "2020/09/08 - The paraben-free label is slapped into most of the skin care brands and cosmetics products. But do you really know what is paraben and is it really harmful? Let’s dig into it. What is Paraben?Parabens are common preservative used in personal care products as well as food. The basic use of preservative is used to expand the shelf life of a product. That is how the paraben works in skin care products. It prevents the growth of mold, fungus and bacteria in the skin care products. Methyl Paraben, Ethyl Paraben, Propyl Paraben and Butyl Paraben are some examples of parabens. Controversies on Parabens!Cancer: Parabens are suspected to have caused cancer on several people. Precisely, breast cancer. Endocrine disruptor: Endocrine disruptors, also known as hormonally active agents, endocrine disrupting chemicals, or endocrine disrupting compounds are chemicals that can interfere with endocrine (or hormonal) systems. These disruptions can cause cancerous tumors, birth defects, and other developmental disorders. Current literature suggests that parabens act as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), with estrogenic effects reported most often. Decreased sperm count: Men with high concentrations of paraben also had a larger proportion of sperm with what’s known as abnormal morphology, or unusual size or shape, that’s associated with infertility. Prenatal Exposure: Prenatal Exposure is a medical condition, where a fetus inside a women’s womb is exposed to unwanted factors such as drugs, radiation, chemical etc. Mood Diruptor: Parabens can act like the hormone estrogen in the body and disrupt the normal function of hormone systems. Environmental Issues: Parabens have been detected in surface waters, fish and sediments as low levels of butylparaben can kill coral, according to laboratory tests (Danaovaro 2008). Facts About Parabens!A lot of controversies on parabens are not backed by enough research and facts. Research upto date hasn’t showed adverse effect by paraben on humans. As said earlier, definitive evidence of harm is lacking. On the other hand, many studies confirms safe usage of parabens. It is said that paraben is able to penetrate deep into the skin but studies show that systematic contact to dermatitis from ingestion is rare. Paraben has been used for several years now and it seems to have low toxicity than what it is assumed of. It is actually very cheap these days given that the chemical is very stable i. e. it doesn't react. It has low rate of allergies compared to other preservatives. The allergy rate of paraben is only at 0. 06%. So, should we buy skin care products with parabens in them?Since there aren’t enough studies that prove parabens are harmful, what is the “paraben free” fuss really about? The Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR), in partnership with the FDA, concluded that parabens are safe to be used in cosmetics. However, all the controversies that have been build up throughout the years about paraben has made people choose paraben free products. If you still have products with parabens in them, don’t waste it and rather use it. To know more about other controversial skin care ingredient, check the following link. "

    "title": "Skin Care Routine For Combination Skin",
    "body": "2020/09/06 - The demography of people having combination skin is high and it’s really super-common. It’s totally normal to be oily in some spots and dry in others and it may need slightly different care in different areas. Typically, there’s a mix of oily and dry areas on different parts of your face, with the t-zone (forehead, nose, and chin) being slightly too oily. I will try to include some of my favourites and no, they’re not sponsored ;) Well, that was some introduction to combination skin, wasn’t it? Hi! I am a skin enthusiast! Here, talking about me, my skin is really dry around the cheeks and the eyes, it tends to get quite oily on the rest of my face which is known as T-zone( categorised as the part of our face, mapping from forehead to nose and for me my chin area too). I do have visible pores and having an oily skin does call for some breakout here and then. I tend to keep my skin’s PH level balanced as much as I can. I never had an acne or any major pimples situation going on throughout my adolescence. However, as I got to my 20’s, I can see how my skin is changing and I am now more indulged regarding my skin care. As I have seen a lot of videos and read a lot of articles regarding skin care. I have probably read and tried everything from my grandmother’s to mom’s to friend’s and dermatologist’s methods of keeping the skin healthy. I am very skeptical about my skin and I always try to do a lot of research before trying anything. Be it from anyone, literally anyone. So, I may have some ideas and tips for people who have Combination skin! Read along for some insights from me. HydrationYeah, really. Water is really essential as if you were expecting anything else. Go sip your water, right now! I’m watching. Go, just do it. I am not going to tell you how important drinking water is for your healthy skin. Get that PH level balanced, babygirl. CleanserStart your day by washing your entire face with a gentle cleanser, there are lots of good brands in Nepal. Personally, I use Biotique Pineapple Foaming Face Wash every morning after I do oil pulling. Yeah, I know it sounds and feels not likely great but I vouch for it. I have seen good results. Lastly, I do recommend VLCC's Chandan/Haldi and Kesar Gel Cleanser. I just love how it smells!At night, wash your face with the same mild cleanser and use an exfoliator (preferably Chemical Exfoliator) twice weekly. Honorable Mentions:THE ORDINARY Glycolic Acid 7% Toning SolutionPixi® skintreats Glow Tonic MoisturiserWhen we use a moisturiser for normal skin, our cheeks feel good, but our T-zone looks like an oil mine! I am sure we have all been there! But we still need to moisturise, using a lotion that combines mattifying ingredients (salicylic acid, silica) with oil-free hydrators (glycerin, hyaluronic acid) could be the saving grace. I use Ahava- Essential Day Moisturiser for Combination Skin! It really does work wonders. Honorable Mentions:Neutrogena Hydro Boost City Shield SPF MoisturiserClean &amp; Clear Oil-Free Moisturizer MaskWhat an absolute treasure! To deep-treat combination skin, use a clay mask on oily areas to draw out excess sebum, dirt, and makeup to prevent breakouts and blackheads from appearing. I use Lotus Herbals Claywhite Face Pack. It’s good. Once a week, just indulge yourself in a spot-treating face with two masks. Apply a moisturising mask to the dry areas and an oil-absorbing clay one to your T-zone. I personally love masks! I just love’em. The face before and after the mask face really gives it away. Note: You can use the oil-absorbing mask up to three times a week. RetinolI don’t know where I would be without using Retinol based serum. When you have combination skin, finding a serum that won’t sway your complexion to the extremes of oily or dry can be tricky. To play on the safe side, opt for a retinol based one – the ingredient plays well with both dry and oily skin, keeping dry patches at bay while helping to prevent clogged pores. When using a retinoid in the daytime, always follow up your retinol serum with SPF. ALWAYS! I have yet to try The Ordinary Retinol Serum - The Ordinary Granactive Retinoid. I will let you know how I feel about it. Honorable Mention:RETINOL SERUM: THE ORDINARY GRANACTIVE RETINOID Blotting PapersWhen the weather is hot, your T-zone tends to get shiny faster than it normally would—usually by midmorning. The quickest solution: blotting papers Honorable Mention:Clean &amp; Clear Oil Absorbing Sheets It’s tricky and it’s very important to know how to use the right products for the right areas. Also, you don’t have to have an expensive skin care routine to have the best skin! There’s quite an understatement for affordable brands that work wonders for your skin. I will try to include some of them and no, it’s not sponsored. "

    "title": "Seven Signs You Have Combination Skin",
    "body": "2020/09/06 - When our skin is either dry or oily, taking care of it is a pretty much straightforward process. But when you’ve got a little bit of both, things start to get complicated. Hydrating creams are very hydrating, oil-absorbing masks are awfully absorbing, balancing lotions never seem to do much balancing, the irony! And that’s bad news for us. Combination skin is very tricky and confusing. Yes, it’s true rather frustrating than confusing. Do you have the same confusion and frustration or you are trying to figure out what is a combination skin? Welcome Sister! You’re in for an enlightening reading session. Well then, put on your glasses and sip your water every time you read “Combination Skin” on this article or any other article. How do you know you have a combination skin?Here’s a Simple Test!. Wash your face and wait for 20 minutes, read some articles ( you can read our other articles too, just a heads up). Touch your T-Zone (forehead, nose, and chin), does it feel sticky or oily? Now touch the rest of your face, is it dry or normal, meaning not as oily as your T-zone? If no, then you continue reading this post as it may have things you might want to try as your skin may not be a combination skin. If yes, then sister. . you are welcome to the Combi-Bombi club! I know little over the top but who really cares, no? Confusion With The Skin Products?: Does it ever happen when you use a moisturiser for a normal skin, it makes your cheeks feel good, but your T-zone looks like an oil mine? We have all been there. Pat yourself, you have come a long way. Use products that are water-based and are pH balanced. Yes, you still need to moisturise, but use a lotion that combines mattifying ingredients (salicylic acid, silica) with oil-free hydrators (glycerin, hyaluronic acid). That’s a must for a combination skin! Pores? Did anyone say Pores?: Trust me, if I hear and see anyone say I have large pores, I’m gonna take care of it. That should be your mindset. If you have pores on your T-Zone greater than the pores around your cheeks or chin then yes, you do have a combination skin! Though nothing has been proven to actually shrink pores, there is a way to make them look smaller. Dermatologists recommend applying products containing retinol, alpha hydroxy acid, or beta hydroxy acid, which help keep pores from getting clogged and at bay. Great news, isn’t it? Does it snow? (Dandruffs): How often does it snow in your place? Often? Not quite? Snow as in Dandruff, gals. You are most likely to have dandruffs and have dry, flaky patches on your scalp. It isn’t a definite indicator but yeah most people tend to have the problem. Use a better and anti-dandruff shampoo to get rid of your snow. Dry Patches and Breakouts?: Tell me about another greater duo beside the guys above. Having a Combi-Bombi Skin, breakouts along with dry patches are the worst thing that can happen to anyone. Use two types of masks, a moisturising and a mattifying one. They can help you with the troubles. Use a clay mask if it’s available. How’s the weather?: The skin mostly reacts to the environment around where you spend most of your time. If it’s hotter you’ll be a glistening god/goddess by mid morning. Always use a blotting paper to avoid having excess oil from your personal oil mine. . kidding! Dry Patches around your T-Zone?: If they have a little bit of yellowness to them, and the skin underneath looks pink and inflamed, you may have seborrheic dermatitis. This condition is often confused with dry skin, but it is an overgrowth of yeast that normally grows on the scalp. People often have dandruff along with it. To clear it up, see your dermatologist, who may prescribe antifungal, anti-yeast, or anti-inflammatory creams. These signs have truth in them, if you have any signs from above. You’re mostly having a combination skin. If you want to know further more about the skin you have, it’s always the better option to visit your dermatologist and get a clear vision about your skin! "

    "title": "The Guide To Active Ingredients in Skin Care and Skin Care Products",
    "body": "2020/09/06 - Active Ingredients are those ingredients in a product that deals with a specific skin condition or skin concern it is meant to target. Hence, if you have acne, you’re looking for products that deal with acne, if you have hyperpigmentation, you’re looking for products that deal with it. If you’re new to active ingredients, you should know what active ingredients are and why is it important in your skincare regimen. As said above, active ingredients are those ingredients that contain an active concentrated ingredient in them. Let’s talk parallelly about the ingredients and skin concerns we must be using them for: Alpha Hydroxy Acids (AHA): ExfoliateAHA, a class of chemical exfoliants is good news to even sensitive skin as they are super safe to use. The most abundantly used active ingredients as common AHA’s in products such as cleansers, toners, masks, and creams to loosen dead skin cells and smooth the skin are Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid, and Mandelic Acid. Unlike using physical exfoliators, chemical exfoliators are much gentler, as Beta Hydroxy Acids (BHA): Clear BreakoutsBHA’s specifically are acne-treating ingredients. Commonly used active ingredients as BHA is Salicylic Acid which a part of a beta-hydroxy acid. Most of the skincare product that deals with acne and breakouts contain salicylic acid. Salicylic Acid is known to remove dead skin cells by getting deep into your pores and cleaning it. Because salicylic acid is a non-comedogenic ingredient, it is more likely to loosen blackheads and clear pores. Also, it is not irritating to your skin as compared to benzoyl peroxide. Vitamin C: Brigten SkinVitamin C is found in various fruits and sold as dietary supplements. It repairs tissue and the enzymatic production of certain neurotransmitters. Ascorbic acid. It is one of the most important and commonly used active ingredients as it has a huge role in collagen synthesis. Vitamin C is a vital molecule for skin health. The antioxidant properties of vitamin C improve the efficiency of sunscreen. It is layered underneath it to help prevent and treat ultraviolet (UV)-induced photodamage. Retinol: Firm and Smooth SkinRetinol is a vitamin A derivative with multiple skin benefits such as skin cell turnover, unclogging pores, smooth skin, refine skin textures, and lighten age spots. It is known for its ability to treat fine lines, wrinkles as well as acne. It is a must-use ingredient in skincare regimen after 20. Hence, Retinol can be said as “the anti-aging” ingredient that has ever been discovered to date. This ingredient could be drying to some skin types and on that note, you have to consult your dermatologist. Do not be confused with Retin A and Tretinoin. Retinol is a derivative of Vitamin A whereas Retin-A and Tretinoin are vitamin A. Hyaluronic Acid: HydrateHyaluronic Acid has an amazing molecular property of holding up to 1,000 times its weight in water. It is a clear, silky smooth substance that is naturally produced by the body. It is able to improve the texture of the skin as well as its appearance. However, our body naturally decreases the production of Hyaluronic acid in our body after 30, which is why it is also a powerful anti-aging skin care ingredient. Niacinamide: Reudce Inflamation: Niacinamide is a form of Vitamin B-3. It has anti-inflammatory properties and antioxidant properties making it one of the active ingredients for treating your skin. A lot of dermatologists ask you to apply topical niacinamide-based products to treat hyperpigmentation, acne, and rosacea. Ceramides: Improve Barrier Function: Ceramides are lipids that help form the skin’s barrier and help skin retain moisture. A healthy skin barrier is a must for obtaining healthy skin and ceramides help you fortify it. Ceramides are naturally produced by the body. And if there’s enough of it, your skin will automatically fight to keep pollutions and dirt out. What ceramide does is make a “water-proof barrier” in the upper layer of the skin. They help in regulating cells and repairing the skin’s natural barrier. Ceramide production decreases with age. Hence, make sure to use a ceramide-based active ingredient in your moisturizer. By doing so, you will help your skin form ceramides on its own. Peptides: Boosts Collagen: A peptide is a short chain of amino acids. They basically communicate between skin cells. They occur naturally and help regulate hormonal activity, activate or deactivate immune responses, and stimulate wound healing. Regular application of peptides will boost your collagen production, stop collagen degradation, and relax the wrinkles ultimately making your skin look younger. Vitamin E: Protect: Vitamin E is typically used in skin care ingredients. It is combined with Vitamin C to stabilize the unusable formulation of Vitamin C. Vitamin E is naturally found in human skin but is depreciated due to the constant exposure of skin in the sun and other environmental factors. Adding Vitamin E in your skin care regimen will give extra protection to your skin. Curcuminoids: Glow: If you’ve ever heard of using turmeric to improve your skin, it is because turmeric consists of Curcuminoids in its powerhouse. It has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. It is able to give you the glow you want when regularly incorporated in your diet. There are capsules that pair curcuminoids with more easily digested lipids for better absorption. These capsules help achieve the skin brightening properties of turmeric. "

    "body": "2020/09/05 - An insight To Dry SkinMedically known as Xerosis, dry skin is not usually serious and is caused by the temperature and humidity level around you. If you have dry skin, you might notice small fine flakes, cracking and dry patches in your skin. You should protect your skin in the morning and hydrate it in the evening that is why, you need to have a proper skin care routine for dry skin Hence, the skin condition could get worst if you do not add a skin care routine for your dry skin. Skin care routine for Dry SkinHydrating Cleanser:Use a very gentle but hydrating cleanser for about a minute to cleanse your skin. Something as gentle as the Himalaya moisturizing aloe vera face wash is a blessing to your skin. And if you would want to steep a little high, opt for a cetaphil gentle skin cleanser. Just make sure the product you’re using doesn’t let your skin feel tight and stripping after the wash. CeraVe's Hydrating Facial Cleanser, which includes ceramides and hyaluronic acid, has been internationally renowned today and seems to be the favorite cleanser for all. And for those who suffer from the redness, consider products with niacinamide as it aids with inflammation. A lot of people use these products in their skin care routine today.  Cleansing Tip for extremely dry skin:Skip using a cleanser and just wash your face with normal water(not too cold, not too hot) to wash your face in the morning. Avoid foaming cleansers. Hydrating Toner:Go easy with toners if you have sensitive skin. because most toners are full of alcohol and unwanted chemicals that are likely to harm your skin. I personally recommend using a gentle toner in your skin that is packed with good hydrating ingredients such as Hyaluronic Acid that would lock up all the moisture in your skin. If serums seem to exceed your budget, opt for a toner with hyaluronic acid. Neutrogena's Alcohol-Free Hydrating Toner can be your best pick.  Toning Tip for dry skin:Skip this step if the ingredient list on the toner you’re using seems to do nothing at all. Also, stop spending your money on Mario Badescu. Serum:Serums are packed with concentrated ingredients. You have to choose an antioxidant protection serum such as Vitamin C in your skin care regimen, especially in the morning, . Vitamin C does wonders for your skin. Vitamin C serum from DermaFix aids your skin beautifully despite a slight fragrance in it. But the ingredient list completely satisfies why it does have fragrance. And for the night, a serum with retinol is a good option. “Retinols can also be applied in serum-form; bakuchiol, a naturally derived retinol is often more tolerable for dry skin. ” Start with minimum concentrate retinol. You can start with Tretin-A, 0. 025%, which is easily available in your nearest drugstore.  Serum Tip for dry skin:Invest in Hyaluronic Acid Serum as retinol is a drying ingredient that has plenty of benefits to your skin. Since you can’t avoid retinol, you have to have good hydrating serums with you. Moisturizer:You need a good moisturizer to hydrate the skin, regardless of the skin type. A good moisturizer for dry skin should have ceramides that do wonders for the skin. Something as gentle as the CeraVe moisturizer works best for the skin. CeraVe, Cetaphil, lubriderm are few of the best dermatologists approved moisturizers for your dry skin.  Moisturizer Tip for dry skin:Never buy products with parabens and denatured alcohol, ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, or benzyl alcohol. These are meant to penetrate your skin deeper but ultimately result in breakouts and drier skin. Eye Cream:Since the under-eye area is more sensitive than others, it’s a lot drier, too. To protect the delicate area, be sure to use a rich eye cream every night before bed. If you’re using a good moisturizer and are short of budget, you may skip this step because eye creams are quite expensive. Himalaya Under Eye Cream however can fit right in your budget. However, CeraVe's under eye cream can be your best pick. Sunscreen:No matter what, do not skip this step in the AM. You have to wear your sunscreen no matter if you’re staying indoors or even wearing makeup. No matter the season, you need to keep your skin safe from the environment. Consider a serum-like formula that won’t give you a streaky white finish. When buying one, always buy SPF 50++. Neutrogena's suncreen and La Roche Posay's spf 50++ are the best pick sunscreen for dry skin. Also, CeraVe can never be out of this list. "

    "body": "2020/09/03 - Skin Care Routine for healthy and glowing skinI have seen plenty of people struggling with their skin and cannot choose the right products for skin care. People my age here in Nepal seem to forever struggle with acne and pores. However, women after pregnancy seem to struggle with both acne as well as hyperpigmentation. Despite the skin care study having discovered multiple ingredients that deal with several skin problems, people still seem to be unaware of what actually works for their skin. And that is why skin care has become so important to me that it made me curious about all that there is to research and know about it. I have very normal skin in the summer, whereas extremely dry and flaky skin in the winter. I however do not suffer from acne other than hormonal ones. I would layer my skin with plenty of moisturizers that did nothing to my flaky skin and I wouldn’t bother to study about it anywhere. About a year ago, I decided to start studying my skin type and what my skin is actually asking for. No, it wasn’t the water because I have dry but not dehydrated skin. There’s a very peculiar difference between dry and dehydrated skin. The dry skin is a result of lack of oil or lipids whereas dehydrated skin is the result of lack of water in the stratum corneum, which is the top layer of the skin. But remember, you need to have dry skin to have dehydrated skin. But hey, let’s not have both of them and try to get a very healthy and normal skin. Since I was struggling with flaky skins on random parts of my face, I decided to make a routine that would help me overcome it. And the answer wasn’t oil on my dry skin. It was using the right products in my skin and starting a routine that is very simple yet cost-effective. Other than that, one small difference I made in my skin was never skipping sunscreen. I often skipped it while being indoors. Little did I know, I was ruining my skin. One of the major problems I faced while starting my skin care was choosing the right products. And of course, if you know Hyram, you want to try all the Hyram suggestions. But I was 10,000 miles away from buying all the Hyram Suggestions. That’s when I decided to search for ingredients that are as gentle as water and wouldn’t harm my skin in the long run. Today, I feel proud of myself for taking a step forward to maintaining healthy skin. It’s not difficult as it seems and there’s so much to learn about one’s own skin. Here are some of the best skin care routine that you can use as per your skin type. These routines by Sheeny Care are lifestyle of several co-workers within.
