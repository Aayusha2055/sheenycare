    <p>Active Ingredients are those ingredients in a product that deals with a specific skin condition or skin concern it is meant to target.
Hence, if you have acne, you’re looking for products that deal with acne, if you have hyperpigmentation, you’re looking for products that deal with it.
If you’re new to active ingredients, you should know what active ingredients are and why is it important in your skincare regimen.</p>

<h1 id="as-said-above-active-ingredients-are-those-ingredients-that-contain-an-active-concentrated-ingredient-in-them">As said above, active ingredients are those ingredients that contain an active concentrated ingredient in them.</h1>

<p>Let’s talk parallelly about the ingredients and skin concerns we must be using them for:</p>

<h1 id="alpha-hydroxy-acids-aha-exfoliate">Alpha Hydroxy Acids (AHA): Exfoliate</h1>
<p>AHA, a class of chemical exfoliants is good news to even sensitive skin as they are super safe to use. The most abundantly used active ingredients as common AHA’s in products such as cleansers, toners, masks, and creams to loosen dead skin cells and smooth the skin are Glycolic Acid, Lactic Acid, and Mandelic Acid.</p>

<p>Unlike using physical exfoliators, chemical exfoliators are much gentler, as</p>

<h1 id="beta-hydroxy-acids-bha-clear-breakouts"><a href="https://www.sheenycare.com/what-is-salicylic-acid/" target="_blank">Beta Hydroxy Acids (BHA): Clear Breakouts</a></h1>
<p>BHA’s specifically are acne-treating ingredients. Commonly used active ingredients as BHA is Salicylic Acid which a part of a beta-hydroxy acid. Most of the skincare product that deals with acne and breakouts contain salicylic acid.</p>

<p><u>Salicylic Acid</u> is known to remove dead skin cells by getting deep into your pores and cleaning it. Because salicylic acid is a non-comedogenic ingredient, it is more likely to loosen blackheads and clear pores. Also, it is not irritating to your skin as compared to benzoyl peroxide.</p>

<h1 id="vitamin-c-brigten-skin"><a href="https://www.sheenycare.com/vitamin-c-benefits-for-skin/" target="_blank">Vitamin C: Brigten Skin</a></h1>
<p>Vitamin C is found in various fruits and sold as dietary supplements. It repairs tissue and the enzymatic production of certain neurotransmitters.</p>

<p>Ascorbic acid is the most pure and potent form of Vitamin C. It is one of the most important and commonly used active ingredients as it has a huge role in collagen synthesis.</p>

<p>Vitamin C is a vital molecule for skin health. The antioxidant properties of vitamin C improve the efficiency of sunscreen. It is layered underneath it to help prevent and treat ultraviolet (UV)-induced photodamage.</p>

<h1 id="retinol-firm-and-smooth-skin">Retinol: Firm and Smooth Skin</h1>
<p>Retinol is a vitamin A derivative with multiple skin benefits such as skin cell turnover, unclogging pores, smooth skin, refine skin textures, and lighten age spots.
It is known for its ability to treat fine lines, wrinkles as well as acne. It is a must-use ingredient in skincare regimen after 20.</p>

<p>Hence, Retinol can be said as “the anti-aging” ingredient that has ever been discovered to date. This ingredient could be drying to some skin types and on that note, you have to consult your dermatologist.</p>

<p>Do not be confused with Retin A and Tretinoin. Retinol is a derivative of Vitamin A whereas Retin-A and Tretinoin are vitamin A.</p>

<h1 id="hyaluronic-acid-hydrate"><a href="https://www.sheenycare.com/hyaluronic-acid-skin-benefits-uses" target="_blank">Hyaluronic Acid:</a> Hydrate</h1>
<p>Hyaluronic Acid has an amazing molecular property of holding up to 1,000 times its weight in water. It is a clear, silky smooth substance that is naturally produced by the body. It is able to improve the texture of the skin as well as its appearance.</p>

<p>However, our body naturally decreases the production of Hyaluronic acid in our body after 30, which is why it is also a powerful anti-aging skin care ingredient.</p>

<h2 id="niacinamide-reudce-inflamation"><a href="https://www.sheenycare.com/what-is-niacinamide/" target="_blank">Niacinamide:</a> Reudce Inflamation</h2>
<p>Niacinamide is a form of Vitamin B-3. It has anti-inflammatory properties and antioxidant properties making it one of the active ingredients for treating your skin. A lot of dermatologists ask you to apply topical niacinamide-based products to treat hyperpigmentation, acne, and rosacea.</p>

<h2 id="ceramides-improve-barrier-function"><a href="https://www.sheenycare.com/what-is-ceramide" target="_blank">Ceramides:</a> Improve Barrier Function</h2>
<p>Ceramides are lipids that help form the skin’s barrier and help skin retain moisture. A healthy skin barrier is a must for obtaining healthy skin and ceramides help you fortify it.</p>

<p>Ceramides are naturally produced by the body. And if there’s enough of it, your skin will automatically fight to keep pollutions and dirt out. What ceramide does is make a “water-proof barrier” in the upper layer of the skin. They help in regulating cells and repairing the skin’s natural barrier.</p>

<p>Ceramide production decreases with age. Hence, make sure to use a ceramide-based active ingredient in your moisturizer. By doing so, you will help your skin form ceramides on its own.</p>

<h2 id="peptides-boosts-collagen">Peptides: Boosts Collagen</h2>
<p>A peptide is a short chain of amino acids. They basically communicate between skin cells. They occur naturally and help regulate hormonal activity, activate or deactivate immune responses, and stimulate wound healing.</p>

<p>Regular application of peptides will boost your collagen production, stop collagen degradation, and relax the wrinkles ultimately making your skin look younger.</p>

<h2 id="vitamin-e-protect">Vitamin E: Protect</h2>
<p>Vitamin E is typically used in skin care ingredients. It is combined with Vitamin C to stabilize the unusable formulation of Vitamin C.</p>

<p>Vitamin E is naturally found in human skin but is depreciated due to the constant exposure of skin in the sun and other environmental factors.</p>

<p>Adding Vitamin E in your skin care regimen will give extra protection to your skin.</p>

<h2 id="curcuminoids-glow">Curcuminoids: Glow</h2>
<p>If you’ve ever heard of using turmeric to improve your skin, it is because turmeric consists of Curcuminoids in its powerhouse. It has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.</p>

<p>It is able to give you the glow you want when regularly incorporated in your diet. There are capsules that pair curcuminoids with more easily digested lipids for better absorption. These capsules help achieve the skin brightening properties of turmeric.</p>
