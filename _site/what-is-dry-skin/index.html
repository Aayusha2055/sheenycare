<p>I’ve struggled with dry skin my entire life. Well, the problem exactly is not limited to the skin on my face. I have rough patches from head to toe, followed by Keratosis Pilaris (chicken skin) in the legs, arms, and back.</p>

<p>Since people all around the world have dry skin, it isn’t a skin condition, rather a skin type. However, there are severe cases, where a skin type is considered a skin condition. They might be eczema, red and irritated skin, medically called <a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/seborrheic_dermatitis/article.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Seborrheic dermatitis</a>, and many more.</p>

<p>These severe cases are a result of ignorance towards dry skin. So, if we start to understand our skin today and analyze what it actually needs, we might be able to avoid such skin conditions later in the future.</p>

<p>So, let’s start by understanding the basics of dry skin and determine a proper self-care routine for dry skin.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-dry-skin">What is dry skin?</h1>

<p>There are three layers that make up the skin. The epidermis is the outermost layer of the skin. When we say we have dry skin, it actually means, that there is a lack of water in the outermost layer of the skin i.e. the epidermis.</p>

<p>It is medically known as Xerosis. Dry skin is not usually serious and is caused by the temperature and humidity level around you. Especially during winter, the air is quite humid inside whereas cold outside. Since the balance between the temperature is uneven, you are more prone to have dry skin in winter.</p>

<p>If you have dry skin, you might notice small fine flakes, cracking, and dry patches in your skin.</p>

<h1 id="what-causes-dry-skin">What causes dry skin?</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Humidity and temperature - have a profound effect on the amount of water retained within the skin.</li>
  <li>Hot bath and showers - for a long time might result in dry skin. So does swimming frequently in chlorinated water.</li>
  <li>Soaps and chemicals - are likely to strip moisture from your skin as they are formulated to remove oil and other skin conditions.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="lifestyle-remedies-for-dry-skin">Lifestyle remedies for dry skin.</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Drink plenty of water.</li>
  <li>Do not bathe daily, instead of doing it every other day.</li>
  <li>Moisturize your skin daily, especially right after you take bath.</li>
  <li>Pat dry your skin after a shower.</li>
  <li>Use hydrating and moisturizing soaps and body wash while showering.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="types-of-dry-skin">Types of Dry Skin</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Dry and Dehydrated Skin</li>
  <li>Acne-Prone Dry Skin</li>
  <li>Dry and Sensitive Skin</li>
  <li>Dry and Aging Skin</li>
</ol>

<p>Now that we have understood the basics, let’s start understanding the routine necessary for several dry skin care types.</p>

<h1 id="daily-skin-care-routine-for-dry-and-dehydrated-skin">Daily Skin Care Routine for Dry and Dehydrated Skin</h1>

<p>When skin doesn’t produce a lot of oil as well as does not retain enough moisture, then such skin is dry and dehydrated skin. The skin is extremely flaky, tight and appearance of fine lines and wrinkles are more visible. Water-based products help retain moisture in the skin. Also, drink plenty of water to supply water in the epidermis.</p>

<h2 id="morning-routine">Morning Routine</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Cleanse:</strong> Always start your morning routine by removing all the dirt and grease build up on the skin overnight. Use a gentle scrub or a cleanser. You can either let your skin dry itself or pat dry it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Moisturize:</strong> People with dry and dehydrated skin should be using a rich hydrating formula that suits the skin type well. Start with a small amount and apply it in circular motions. Keep adding a small amount until it is completely absorbed by the skin. Your skin should not feel oily or greasy after applying the moisturizer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Eye Cream:</strong> The area around our eyes do not produce any natural oil. In fact, it is the area that is more problematic for people with dry and dehydrated skin types. Hence, a good eye balm or cream can help stimulate the area around the eyes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Sunscreen and Makeup:</strong> Cosmetics are always the last step of any skin care routine and so is for dehydrated and dry skin care. Use hydrating and moisturized SPF of 30+ UVA protection. Always wear sunscreen before makeup. Also, use hydrating and moisturizing lip balms on your chapped lips.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="day-care">Day Care</h2>
<p>If your skin seems to be immediately dry, or slowly you seem to feel a lack of moisture then dab a few spots of moisturizer in the skin. Also, do the same thing with lip balms.</p>

<h2 id="night-routine">Night Routine</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Double Cleanse:</strong> Always start your night routine by removing all the dirt, make-up and grease build up on the skin during the day. Use a make-up remover first to remove the make-up and SPF. Switch to water cleanser after removing the make-up to cleanse remaining residues on the skin.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Exfoliate:</strong> If you experience flaky patches, you need to exfoliate as well. Choose an exfoliation product with very fine, gentle particles that won’t irritate your skin or cause any redness.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Hydrating Serum:</strong> If you have dry and dehydrated skin, a hydrating serum is a must to restore all the nourishment you have lost during the day. Take a generous amount and massage it on your skin until it is absorbed properly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Night Cream:</strong> Make sure to complete your routine with proper night cream with plenty of skin repair ingredient that prevents the skin barrier as well as lost of moisture in the skin.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Eye Cream:</strong> Also add a good eye cream to your skin care routine to prevent any further dryness around the eyes as well as to prevent aging.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h1 id="daily-skin-care-routine-for-dry-and-acne-prone-skin">Daily Skin Care Routine for Dry and Acne-Prone Skin</h1>
<p>The skin with dryness and acne is tight throughout the year along with loss of elasticity. The skin is red and bumpy consistently on areas with acne and gets irritated easily. Harsh and drying products sensitizes the skin. That is why such skin requires active ingredients such as peptides to soothe the skin. Furthermore, it requires calming and brightening ingredients to deal with redness and Salicylic Acid to deep cleanse pores.</p>

<h2 id="morning-routine-1">Morning Routine</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Cleanse:</strong> Always start your morning routine by removing all the dirt and grease build up on the skin overnight. Alter between a gentle cleanse and exfoliating cleanser in the morning. You can either let your skin dry itself or pat dry it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Serum:</strong> People with dry and dehydrated skin should be using a protective formula that suits the skin type well. <a href="https://www.sheenycare.com/vitamin-c-benefits-for-skin/" target="_blank">Vitamin C</a> serum is the one people are most obsessed with. Start with a small amount and apply it in circular motions. Keep adding a small amount until it is completely absorbed by the skin. Your skin should not feel oily or greasy after applying the moisturizer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Moisturize:</strong> Choose a rich hydrating formula that suits the skin type well. Always buy a moisturizer with <a href="https://www.sheenycare.com/hyaluronic-acid-skin-benefits-uses/" target="_blank">Hyaluronic Acid</a>. You can alter moisturizer with neuropeptides that are soothing for irritated skin and hydrating ceramides for lightweight consistency.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Sunscreen and Makeup:</strong> Cosmetics are always the last step of any skin care routine and so is for acne-prone and dry skin care. Use hydrating and tinted sunscreen SPF of 30+ UVA protection. Always wear sunscreen before makeup. Also, use hydrating and moisturizing lip balms on your chapped lips.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="day-care-1">Day Care</h2>
<p>If your skin seems to be immediately dry, or slowly you seem to feel a lack of moisture then dab a few spots of moisturizer in the skin. Also, do the same thing with lip balms.</p>

<h2 id="night-routine-1">Night Routine</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Double Cleanse:</strong> Always start your night routine by removing all the dirt, make-up and grease build up on the skin during the day. Use an oil cleanser first to remove the make-up and SPF. Switch to benzoyl peroxide cleanser after removing the make-up to cleanse remaining residues on the skin.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Treatments:</strong> It is important to spot treat breakouts for people of oily skin type. Normally, such treatments are drying in nature and hence should not be applied all over the face, rather than the areas where you need specifically treat. This is really important especially for people of both dry and acne-prone nature, as they have to balance the moisture in the skin.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Hydrating Serum:</strong> If you have dry and dehydrated skin, a hydrated serum is a must to restore all the nourishment you have lost during the day. Take a generous amount and massage it on your skin until it is absorbed properly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Night Cream:</strong> Make sure to complete your routine with proper night cream with plenty of skin repair ingredient that prevents the skin barrier as well as lost of moisture in the skin.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Eye Cream:</strong> Also add a good eye cream to your skin care routine to prevent any further dryness around the eyes as well as to prevent aging.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h1 id="best-foods-for-dry-skin-care">Best Foods For Dry Skin Care</h1>
