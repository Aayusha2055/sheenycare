    <p>The paraben free label is slapped into most of the skin care brands and cosmetic products. With new ingredients in the market everyday, we have now been conscious about not only what goes inside our body but also what we put on our skin.</p>

<p>But now, since we have so many ingredients to choose from, can we really differentiate which ingredient is safe for us and which one is bad, can you? Especially those, which might have failed to prove it’s well intention and was mislead. Among them are parabens.</p>

<p>Parabens now have been used for years in skin care, cosmetic and makeup products. Though over the year it has been said to be harmful and might have caused several side effects on people, let’s find out if these claims are actually true or not.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-paraben-in-skin-care">What is Paraben in skin care?</h2>
<p>Parabens are common chemical preservative first introduced in 1950s. It has ever since been used in personal care products as well as food. The basic use of preservative is to expand the shelf life of a product. That is how paraben works in skin care products as well. It prevents the growth of mold, fungus and bacteria in them.</p>

<p>Parabens can be found on commercially available moisturizers, shampoos, serums, lotions, creams, even toothpaste and almost all cosmetics products. Products containing parabens can last for months and even years.</p>

<p>The most commonly used parabens are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Benzyl Paraben</li>
  <li>Methyl Paraben</li>
  <li>Ethyl Paraben</li>
  <li>Butyl Paraben</li>
  <li>Isobutyl Paraben</li>
  <li>Propyl Paraben</li>
  <li>Isopropyl Paraben</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="where-are-parabens-found">Where are Parabens found?</h2>
<p>Parabens are derived from Para-Hydroxybenzoic acid. They also occur in many fruits and vegetables such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Blueberries</li>
  <li>Carrots</li>
  <li>Onions</li>
  <li>Cucumber</li>
  <li>Cherries</li>
</ul>

<p>We can see that parabens are found in fruits and vegetables that we eat almost every day. What this proves is, paraben does have a limit or safe concentration even on foods we eat. Obviously, we do not eat almost every berry we find on woods, do we?</p>

<p>Not only fruits and vegetables, but we even consume parabens from packaged foods such as dried meats, cereals, pickles, jams and sauces and many more.</p>

<p>Hence, the toxicity in parabens is also directly related to the concentration used in any product.</p>

<h2 id="are-parabens-bad-for-your-skin">Are parabens bad for your skin?</h2>
<p>Parabens can preserve a product for a longer time. Since preservatives primarily are considered bad, so is paraben. There are several controversies that has come up which claims that parabens are bad for us as they can alter or disrupt how some biological system works.</p>

<p>On my research, I found that, when carrying out stydy on parabens, the concentration sample was up to 100% whereas, much lower percentage (less than 1%) is only used to preserve cosmetic products. On other study, large quantity of parabens were fed to animals rather than topically applying like any other skin care products.</p>

<p>Since the researched concentration is way too high than what used in the cosmetic product, all the claims made for parabens might be true for the researched concentration. However, the concentration used in skin care are not backed by enough research.</p>

<p>Let’s look at major effects studies have found on using way too much parabens.</p>

<h3 id="cancer">Cancer</h3>
<p>Parabens are suspected to have caused cancer on several people. Precisely, breast cancer. It is said to able to penetrate the skin in a deeper level to cause such effect.</p>

<h3 id="fun-fact">Fun Fact</h3>
<p>A lot of controversies on parabens are not backed by enough research and facts. Research up to date hasn’t shown adverse effects by paraben on humans. Definitive evidence of harm is lacking.</p>

<h3 id="endocrine-disruptor">Endocrine disruptor</h3>
<p>Endocrine disruptors, also known as hormonally active agents, endocrine disrupting chemicals, or endocrine disrupting compounds are chemicals that can interfere with endocrine (or hormonal) systems.</p>

<p>These disruptions can cause cancerous tumors, birth defects, and other developmental disorders. Current literature suggests that parabens act as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), with estrogenic effects reported most often.</p>

<h3 id="fun-fact-1">Fun Fact</h3>
<p>It has low rate of allergies compared to other preservatives. The allergy rate of paraben is only at 0.06%.</p>

<h3 id="decreased-sperm-count">Decreased sperm count:</h3>
<p>Men who had used high concentrations of paraben also had a larger proportion of sperm with what’s known as abnormal morphology, or unusual size or shape, which is also associated with infertility.</p>

<h3 id="fun-fact-2">Fun Fact</h3>
<p>Paraben has been used for several years now and it seems to have low toxicity than what it is assumed of. It is actually very cheap these days.</p>

<h3 id="prenatal-exposure">Prenatal Exposure</h3>
<p>Prenatal Exposure is a medical condition, where a fetus inside a women’s womb is exposed to unwanted factors such as drugs, radiation, chemical etc.</p>

<h3 id="fun-fact-3">Fun Fact</h3>
<p>The chemical is very stable i.e. it doesn’t react to cause such effect.</p>

<h3 id="mood-disruptor">Mood Disruptor</h3>
<p>Parabens can act like the hormone estrogen in the body and disrupt the normal function of hormone systems. Some researches concludes that paraben chemicals in personal care products were linked to earlier puberty in girls.</p>

<h3 id="environmental-issues">Environmental Issues</h3>
<p>Parabens have been detected in surface waters, fish and sediments as low levels of butyl paraben can kill coral, according to laboratory tests (Danaovaro 2008).</p>

<p>These findings indicate that parabens are harmful to the environment. Not all claims are backed by enough research but yes we can assure that in the long run parabens may question the safety of environment.</p>

<p>It is yet uncertain what negative impacts paraben can impose on metabolism, reproductive health and genetic expression on animal health.</p>

<h2 id="so-should-we-buy-skin-care-products-with-parabens">So, should we buy skin care products with parabens?</h2>
<p>As said above, there aren’t enough studies that prove parabens are harmful. The <u>Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR)</u>, in partnership with the FDA, concluded that parabens are safe to be used in cosmetics.</p>

<p>The reason behind this being, only a small amount of concentration is used in those cosmetics and skin care products. Regardless, it is as difficult to say parabens are safe as it is to say parabens are harmful or bad. Now, we have many alternatives to parabens avialable in the market so we have an option to choose products which do not contain parabens in them.</p>

<p>The researches made on parabens do make us aware that over using such can cause problems such as cancer, adverse effect on digetive and reproductive system. Hence, it is always better to be smarter than to regret later.</p>

<p>Since the ingredient itself has been controversial and many have come up with a better alternative, you can choose what best fits your skin.</p>

<h2 id="most-commonly-asked-question-on-parabens">Most commonly asked question on parabens.</h2>

<h3 id="1-which-face-creams-are-paraben-free">1. Which face creams are paraben free?</h3>
<p>Many moisturizers are available in the market that are free of parabens. Some of the best paraben free moisturizerss are listed below:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/protini-tm-polypeptide-cream-P427421?icid2=products%20grid:p427421" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Drunk Elephant

</ul>

<h3 id="2-is-cetaphil-paraben-free">2. Is cetaphil paraben free?</h3>
<p>Like many skin care brands and products, cetaphil does contain parabens because they are an effective preservative used from years in skin care brands. Although they contain parabens, ceptaphil is certified of using parabens free of causing allergies.</p>

<p>However, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cetaphil-Soothing-Paraben-Hypoallergenic-Colloidal/dp/B07N61TPY4#:~:text=Gentle%20Care%20For%20Delicate%20Skin&amp;text=Cetaphil%20Baby%20Soothing%20Wash%20is%20made%20with%20NO%20parabens%20or%20fragrance." target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cetaphil Baby Soothing Wash</a> is made with no parabens or fragrance.</p>

<h3 id="3-what-are-the-dangers-of-using-parabens">3. What are the dangers of using parabens?</h3>
<p>As said earlier, parabens are known to disrupt hormone function, an effect that is linked to increased risk of breast cancer and reproductive toxicity.</p>

<p>A controversial group of chemicals commonly found in lotions and other personal care products such as parabens may be more dangerous at low doses than previously thought, according to a new study.</p>

<p>Hence, when buying a product with parabens, make sure to understand the concentration of the ingredient.</p>

<p>If you still have products with parabens in them, don’t waste it and rather use it. But make sure you’re using it safely. Since we found that a lot these claims on parabens are not backed by enough research for the quantity we apply in the skin, we can still say it is safe.</p>

<p>However, we must also understand it’s consequences on the environment and marine plants and animals. Hence, if it is to cause risk in the long term then there are many other alternatives of parabens used today in skin care.</p>

<p>It’s always to prevent ourselves than to face any consequences. Hence, choose your product wisely.</p>
